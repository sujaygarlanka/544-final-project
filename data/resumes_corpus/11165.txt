An example of this is his senior project which talks about the increasing difficulty in finding accurate information on the Internet by examining issues of relevancy. Ryan produces work that is to the point, simple and conceptual coherent. Ryan shows a high level of focus and motivation enabling him to attach difficult technical and conceptual problems.
