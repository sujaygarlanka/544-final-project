Contract Software Developer Contract <span class="hl">Software</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Contract Software Developer - FromThePage Austin, TX I am a generalist, full-stack web developer. I have worked on static HTML sites, dynamic sites built with server side MVC frameworks and modern client-side single page apps. I have worked on projects of varying sizes in JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Python, Rust, Elixir, HTML, and CSS (including SASS). I’m not dogmatic; I like using the right tool for the job.    I’m a clear writer and speaker. I’ve taught undergraduate and graduate courses and presented and published original academic research. I work hard to be direct, diplomatic, and professional with all of my colleagues. I speak-up when I have an informed opinion and I work hard to listen to the opinions of my colleagues.    As graduate student, I completed coursework in classical languages, critical theory, middle eastern history, material culture, and historical linguistics. All the while, I worked to maintain proficiencies in software development and to expand my software skill set. I work hard to learn new domains quickly and to put that knowledge into practice. Work Experience Contract Software Developer FromThePage April 2018 to Present FromThePage is a medium-sized open source transcription product for use by documentary historians. It is built with Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Sass, Rspec/Capybara. My role has focused on bug fixes, writing and expanding the unit and integration test suite, and designing and implementing new features. I've also worked on database query performance, third-party API's and specs, mailers, UX improvements, and web accessibility. Instructor / Researcher The University of Texas at Austin - Austin, TX 2013 to 2019 I was employed by the University of Texas while completing my Ph.D. as as researcher, instructor, and teaching assistant.    As a research assistant, I was the primary technical liaison for the Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon Project, which was a digital project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. I prototyped several iterations of the CMS for the project, initially using Node.js/MongoDB and later using PHP/Laravel. I prototyped the front-end as a single page app with Ember.js and SASS.    I've also worked on several small personal projects related to my research of the ancient Near East, including a searchable Mesopotamian Cuneiform Sign List compiled from Open Access data repositories. Using this data, we have been able  to generate statistical information useful for reading Cuneiform. This project was originally built with Python/Flask but I am currently working to rewrite and expand the project using Gatsby/React and GraphQL and augmenting the data using NLP tools such as the Classical Languages Tool Kit. Library Assistant / WordPress Developer Milligan College 2009 to 2013 As a library assistant I built and maintained the library's website. I developed custom WordPress themes that aligned with the college's branding guidelines using fully responsive layouts. I wrote several WordPress plugins to integrate with third-party API's and services.    I also gathered and interpret metrics for the library as a whole. These metrics included usage data for the library's digital resources, lending collection, and physical usage. This data helped driving purchasing decisions and formed a central component of the library's narrative during the re-accreditation process by the US Dept. of Education.
