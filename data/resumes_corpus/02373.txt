JNTU-Hyderabad July 2012 to May 2013 Enterprise Information System Migratory or Data Transformation Services (DTS) Undergraduate Project-JNTU- Final year  Enterprise Information System Migratory or Data Transformation Services (DTS) is a very powerful yet easy to use data movement facility that can transfer data. It enables data movement between data sources, (Access, Oracle, SQL server, MySQL)  Environment: JSP, SERVLETS, Oracle 9i, SQL Server, MS Access, MySQL    • Catching Packet Droppers and Modifiers In Wireless Sensor Networks (Undergraduate Project-JNTU- Final year)  Packet dropping and modification are common attacks that can be launched by an adversary to disrupt communication in wireless multi hop sensor networks. Many schemes have been proposed to mitigate or tolerate such attacks, but very few can effectively and efficiently identify the intruders. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective scheme, which can identify misbehaving forwarders that drop or modify packets.  Environment: Dot net, C# and SQL Education Masters in Computer Information Systems and Information Technology in Computer Information Systems and Information Technology University of Central Missouri Technology Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad - Hyderabad, ANDHRA PRADESH, IN Skills DataBase (4 years), maintenance (3 years), MS SQL Server (3 years), SQL (4 years), SQL Server (3 years) Additional Information Technical Skills:  RDBMS SQL Server 2014/2012/2008r2/2008/2005/2000  SQL Server Tools  SQL Server Enterprise Manager, T-SQL, SQL Server Profiler, SQL Server Query Analyzer, Import/Export Tools, SQL Server Agent, SQL Jobs, SQL Server Management Studio, DataBase Maintenance Plan    ETL Tools Business Intelligence Development Studio (SSIS, SSAS, SSRS), Data Transformation Services (DTS), DBCC.    Operating Systems  Windows NT, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows 2008 R2 server, Windows 2003 Server, Windows XP Professional/Standard, windows server 2012    Languages C/C++, JAVA, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP.NET, UML
