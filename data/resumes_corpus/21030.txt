Software Developer <span class="hl">Software</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Moore, OK I began working at Dayton Tires factory in 1999 at the age of 21 and continued working there until December 2006, when the factory was closed to move to Mexico. I began in the warehouse and moved to the curing department after a year, and ended my career as a tire builder.    I began the associate's degree program at Rose State College in 2007, focusing on cyber security and networking. I graduated in 2009 with a 3.778 GPA.    I gained a position with Chickasaw Nation Industries at the tier I support desk and quickly gained a tier II position followed by a team lead position managing a new program roll out and engineering the deployment and maintenance procedures.     I also learned software development during this time utilizing people nice enough to help, the internet, and Barns & Noble book store, and gained a civil service position as a software developer in 2012.     I participated in software license management, source selection, rapid improvement groups, and oversaw the updating and maintenance of several applications and won a few awards during my time in this position.     In 2016 I began working at a family owned business Baldwin & Sons Drywall with my cousin and I have decided that it is time to get back into the technical field.     I’m looking to get back into the support and administration aspect of the field rather than the development.     Thanks for reading.
