Web Developer <span class="hl">Web</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Eastport, NY Work Experience Web Developer Estates On Line, LLC 2007 to Present Over 15 years’ experience in IT, web development, and digital marketing.    I bring over 15 years experienced as professional web development and digital marketing expert. I produce websites that are both visually appealing and highly functional, with satisfied customers who recommend me and hire me for their continuing needs. Over the years, I've built a company comprised of co- developers specialized in most languages and platforms.     After many years as a freelance developer, I’ve built a sizable team of professionals that can handle virtually any IT requirement; offering clients complete assurance of satisfaction. This gives my clients a huge benefit over hiring a freelancer, many of whom promise more than they can deliver.    1. I and my team have more extensive technical abilities than any single programmer/ developer. As software has evolved in complexity, the ability of any one individual to handle a job from start to finish is extremely limited.  2. I am competitively priced and can offer a quote on smaller jobs. Otherwise, I work on an hourly basis and can roughly estimate the hours your job will require, so your project costs are controlled.  3. Because of the broad talents I offer, every job is done the 1st time, every time. Many firms hiring an in-house developer find that he/she stumbles on the job and the work has to be re-done. This will never happen when you work with me.     With over 15 years of personal programming experience, I manage all the work my shop turns out. You are also assured local and personal service and attention as I'm located on Long Island.     Please see my site at https://estatesonline.net.    My broad skills in information technology and marketing, coupled with real-world experience in growing sales, should give you the confidence in hiring me for your web and marketing requirements.
