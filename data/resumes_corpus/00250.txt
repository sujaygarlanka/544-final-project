When I first came to Blue Chip I had thought it would be in a very specific capacity as a SQL  developer. After going through the hiring process they decided that with the skills I had to offer I would  be more valuable managing the systems, and infrastructure. So on top of my work helping with the database, I have managed the servers, network, phone system, and all end users here at Blue chip. Sql Developer/Interim Food for Health International July 2017 to December 2018 Director of IT    I came into the FFH team in July of 2017. I was hired to fix a good amount of issues that had been created by the previous IT staff. Key among the fixes I was brought on to fix were a shipping Pick Pack system that  had not been fully implemented and fix major issues with the databases and speed issues. I was able to  get the CASI pick pack system running through fixes to the programming. I also brought the servers and databases up to speed and was able to make serious improvements to the latency and usability of the ERP  system.
