UI/UX Developer UI/UX <span class="hl">Developer</span> UI/UX Developer Los Angeles, CA Re: Enrique Martinez     To Whom It May Concern,    I am pleased to write a letter of recommendation on behalf of Enrique Martinez, who for the past 3 years has performed consulting work at United Airlines.    Enrique has been a lead UX/UI developer responsible for creating new interfaces for the next generation United Airlines Reservations web application. The goal of this multi-year project is to create a modern, efficient web application to replace the legacy airline desktop software supporting thousands of Contact Center Agents around the world.     As a web developer and designer, Enrique had a critical role working directly with business users/product owners to create UI prototypes. The team uses a Continuous Integration design process to produce high fidelity prototypes, requiring constant changes and very short turnaround time. Enrique truly was the star on the team. It became commonplace for Enrique to rewrite CSS and JavaScript while still in the design review meetings. His ability to quickly deliver updates and changes to designs in this fast-paced environment made him the go-to person on the team.    Enrique is very fluid in his code writing abilities and has excellent UI design skills. I would consider Enrique a senior level developer in web interface technologies using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He was responsible for full website development, deployment, debugging, and content management.     Demonstrated skills using:   HTML5/HTML, CSS3/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, ES6, Knockout.js, Angular JS 1.x, Angular2, Gulp.js, Node.js, JSON, Jasmine, Webpack, Fiddler, IE11/Chrome/Firefox compatibility, Electron Browser Container, TFS, GIT, Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio Code, and Web Storm.    If you would like additional information about Mr. Martinez, you can call me at (773) 803-5xxx    Sincerely,  Manager – Information Technology  United Airlines Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience UI/UX Developer United Airlines - Chicago, IL March 2016 to August 2019 - Designed and implemented UX strategy for United Airlines' Compass call center application  - Worked directly with product owners when designing and iterating over new prototype designs  - Built and initiated ux prototyping model and style guide effort for an enterprise level product  - Delivered high fidelity designs with production ready code  html5, scss, js, bootstrap, adobe creative suite, angular.js & angular 2+, git/agile, gulp/webpack, node Freelance Web Developer Wheeler Multimedia - Chicago, IL October 2012 to December 2018 - Front end development - Photoshop PSDs to Functional websites using HTML/CSS & Javascript  - Created website designs and mock-ups in Adobe Photoshop  - Wordpress theme development  - Developed scalable templates for portfolios using HTML5/CSS3 (LESS & Bootstrap) & Javascript  html5, css/less, js/jquery, mysql, php, wordpress, bootstrap, adobe creative suite Front End Web Developer WebToMed Group - Schaumburg, IL 2015 to 2015 - Sliced PSD Designs into websites built around a proprietary PHP/MySQL CMS System  - Used HTML5/CSS3 and CSS Preprocessors to create reusable website templates (LESS & Bootstrap)  - Worked with designers and back-end developers to tailor CMS functionality per client  html5, css/LESS, js/jquery, php/mysql, bootstrap, adobe creative suite Front End Developer MyEbit.com - Kenosha, WI March 2011 to July 2012 - Created UI for site with HTML/CSS & Javascript and graphic design work  - Designed site layout and navigation  - Developed new features for user profiles  html, css, js, jquery, svn, mysql, php, adobe creative suite E Commerce Web Administrator SouthportRigging.com - Kenosha, WI March 2005 to March 2011 - Developed and maintained web applications to help navigate inventory database (access/sql)  - Created macros to inject relevant meta information based on product descriptions (seo)  - Used Google Analytics reports to improve SEO and Google Ads to drive online sales and visits  html, css, js, adobe creative suite, counterpoint cponline, microsoft access, SQL, SEO, Google Ads / Analytics Education Web Development & Administration Gateway Technical College - Kenosha, WI 2010 to 2011 Web Design & Interactive Media Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago, IL 2007 to 2009 None in Marketing Gateway Technical College - Kenosha, WI 2006 to 2007 Skills CSS3, Angular, Javascript, UI Development, Front-End Development, HTML5, Bootstrap, Wireframes and Prototyping, UI Design, SASS / SCSS, User Experience Design, Jquery, User Interface Links http://enriquemartinezmedia.com
