Python/Django Developer <span class="hl">Python</span>/Django <span class="hl">Developer</span> Python/Django Developer Jersey City, NJ Work Experience Python/Django Developer Self May 2017 to Present Projects I have made from start to finish:  Multi Vendor Shopping Cart: A Amazon style multi vendor shopping cart Where multiple users can list  items for sale for other users to buy.  Key Features:  ? Members can create their own Ebay style listings or if there is already a popular listing for a DVD  and they have the exact same item to offer. They can just add their item to the listing (This way  they do not have to go through the trouble of making a listing)  ? 1 item can have multiple sellers. The user will be able to see the listing with all the sellers who are  offering the item for sale with different prices and conditions (Giving the buyer a bigger selection and choice)  ? Stripe connect payment (still in the works): A system where the One member pays directly to the  other member for the merchandize and the platform owner just gets a commission (10% - 15%)  or whatever they have decided. If there is a chargeback, The seller of the merchandize has to deal with the chargebacks. This greatly reduces the payments risk for the platform owner    Meet Up type Web App: A multi-user activity web app Where members can host events. Example "A  Python hackathon in the microsoft bldg on 1st October" or "Singles from 21 to 40 meet up in the Iguana  Club"  Key Features:  ? Members have to get verified to host events. They provide a govt id and pay a charge to get  verified (created a user_is_verified mixin)  ? Members get to see events in a 50 mile radius (default can be changed) of where they are (Used  GeoDjango to achieve this functionality). Sorted by distance  ? Used a multi vendor Shopping cart for this functionality. As in, any member can create and host  an event and charge  ? Members can create a sub-event from a major event. Example:- There is a Lunar Eclipse which is  really popular. You can add your event to that event so members who can't attend the main event  for, distance, price have other options    Stack Overflow type Web App: A multi-user question and answer web app. Where users can ask a question on a specific topic and other members would answer the Questions  Key Features:  ? Users Can choose which topic to ask a Question on, Coding, Music, Litterature, Astronomy etc  ? Members can upvote or downvote a question  ? Members can ask clarification about a question. Example "coding:Can I see the rest of the code?", " Literature: where did you get that quote from" So they can give accurate answers to the  question  ? Members can answer the questions. The answers can be upvoted or downvoted. Also users can  comment on the answers. Example "This is just a temporary fix, this code won't work in production" or "I have downvoted this answer because " Developer ST.LLC - Kearny, NJ September 2012 to May 2017 Built, Managed and maintained their e-commerce site.  ?
