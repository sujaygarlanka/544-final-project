Web Developer/Designer <span class="hl">Web</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span>/Designer Oakland, CA My name is Donna Tate. I have been in print and web design since 1998. I love what I do and I love learning as much as I can to be the best I can at what I do. Both print and web have their own sets of rules and I like pushing both to get great results. There is nothing worse than stagnant design.

Web & Graphic Designer Anderson Printing - Oakland, CA 1996 to 2000 I actually got my start in web and print design here. The company needed a web-  site so the sent me to school at the Graphic Arts Institute to learn web design so I  could build them a site. I also learned as much as I could about the print industry,  from paper to print and bindery which gave me a better insight into print design.
