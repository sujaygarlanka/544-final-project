Full Stack Developer Full Stack <span class="hl">Developer</span> Full Stack Web Developer | React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Wordpress Sunrise, FL Throughout my years in the business development industry I did sales, marketing, management and some finance. Even though all the positions were different, they all had something in common... drum rolls... technology. I found it mesmerizing how all my previous positions rely heavily on technology, and how having a wifi issue at work will immediately kill the productivity for the rest of the work day.    My curiosity started to kick in and I decided to dwell into the magical world of technology. After some googling and a quick tutorial I was able to show the string "Hello World" in my console. It was my first line of code, my first time given a computer a command. I was in shock, it felt so good, it was like acquiring a super power.    The more time I spend coding the more I enjoyed it, so I decided to take a leap of faith, learn to code and transition my career to the technology sector. I enrolled in the online full stack web development program at Flatiron School were I obtain skills in HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux.     Now I want to join my new web development skills with my business development background and help companies achieve their full potential.     If you want to take a look at my code check my GitHub account at: https://github.com/etellezp  You can also find me at my website: https://tellezweb.com Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Full Stack Developer Flatiron School - Sunrise, FL January 2019 to Present Technical Projects:    Uncubicle: A React frontend with Ruby on Rails backend that let's you find workers for your event  + GitHub link: https://github.com/etellezp/event-jobs-client  + Use Redux library for state management   + Use Ruby on Rails as an API  + Use fetch API to communicate between the backend and frontend  + Use Bootstrap for styling    Materia Prima: A Ruby on Rails application that let's you find raw materials  + GitHub link: https://github.com/etellezp/materia-prima   + Use MVC pattern   + Restful routes  + It has CRUD functionality    Scuba Records: A Ruby on Rails application that let's you search for dive sites and record dives   + GitHub link: https://github.com/etellezp/ScubaRecords  + Use JQuery for frontend and DOM manipulation  + Use Devise gem for login and logout functionality  + Use Bootstrap for styling Web Developer / Manager Express Machinery Solutions - Miami, FL February 2016 to January 2019 + Developed the business website for the company    * Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a simple business website   * Contact form and mobile responsive    + Collaborate with the accounting department with profit and loss analysis  + Acquired clients in Latin American markets  + Helped the sales team achieve $200k in revenue in the first yea Sales Representative Paramount Transport and Trading Company - Doral, FL May 2013 to January 2016 + Used the CRM software Salesforce to interact with customer data and sales analysis  + Quote prices credit terms and other bid specifications  + Economic consulting to the Regional Manager for countries in Latin America  + Oversee accounts receivable and accounts payable Business Analyst Alpha Pinturas - Caracas, VE June 2008 to August 2011 + Assisted CEO with the company financial administration, marketing strategies  + Prepared Profit/Cost Analysis, Sales and Business reports  + Designed a market penetration analysis for the implementation of a new product, resulting in opening of a distribution center in the city of Barranquilla in Colombia Education Full Stack Web Development Flatiron School May 2017 to May 2019 Bachelor's in Economics St. Thomas University - Miami, FL August 2011 to April 2014 Skills CSS3 (2 years), Git (2 years), Javascript (2 years), Rails (2 years), github (2 years), react (1 year), bootstrap (2 years), Wordpress (2 years), Front End (2 years), HTML5 (2 years), Redux (1 year), HTML (2 years) Links https://github.com/etellezp https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-tellez/ https://tellezweb.com/ https://codewars.com/users/etellezp
