Python Program <span class="hl">Python</span> Program San Jose, CA Work Experience Python Program HMM(Hidden Markov Model) on Path-based Map Matching, Northwestern University - Evanston, IL March 2016 to November 2016 • Used Python verified the positive impact of Hidden Markov Model on increasing precision of map-matching, as well as processed large scale data and parsed over a million car’s real GPS points with real highway map of Rome, Italy by using Python-Basemap.  • Corrected 3.28 percent of car’s GPS points of traditional algorithm. Software Engineer Cadence Design Systems - Austin, TX June 2016 to September 2016 • Individually implemented a command-line-based user interactive searching interface by accessing back-end libraries and wrapped C++ programs to Python-module.  • Deeply knew the flow of companies’ back-end system and the interface brings convenience to product engineers’ testing and leads to a 50% reduction in programmer’s debugging time.  • Solved the conflict between C++ and Python during transaction and the wrapping project reduced testing time of product engineers by 15%. In total wrote more than 1500 lines codes. Algorithm & Python Programming Machine Learning, Northwestern Univerity - Evanston, IL March 2016 to June 2016 • Implemented Decision Tree with Python in two-people group and achieved over 85%’s accuracy.  • Predicted spam text messages on mobile devices in four-people team by collecting own data sets with parsing websites and interviewing with mobile device users. Through comparison and then found Random Forest can be  the most suitable method which obtains more than 90% accuracy on identification.  • Individually designed a website platform and post our achievement as a public assessment.  (http://angelanki.github.io/ml.pro j/). Database Developer Northwestern University - Evanston, IL September 2015 to December 2015 • Implemented a command-line-based student registration system in a two-people team. Built the accessing port with C++ and called query statements with mysql library. Wrote triggers, stored procedures and a well-done database with SQL language.
