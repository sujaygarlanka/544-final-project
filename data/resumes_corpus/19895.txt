Research Assistant UTSA - San Antonio, TX August 2016 to December 2017 ? Office of Personnel Management Data Breach Characterization 08/2016-11/2017  (Tools: Python 3.0 (Anaconda), Numpy, SciPy, Panda, NLTK libraries)  ? Research work focused on characterizing public reaction (sentiment analysis) for OPM (Office of Personal Management) data breach notification on Twitter.   ? Worked with huge volume of Twitter data for categorizing that into several topics using topic model algorithm such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Algorithm).   ? Further, reduced data was presented in form of simplified graphs using social network analysis tools - Gephi and NodeXL.     ? Privacy profiling of Online Social Networking Users 08/2016-11/2017  (Tools: Python 3.0 (Anaconda), Scikit-learn, Numpy, SciPy, Panda, matplotlib)   ? Research goal was to study different approaches in privacy controls for social networking sites. An efficient privacy model for reliable prediction of features was prepared using machine learning algorithms.  ? The methodology was based on selecting best features from the data set using forest based decision trees and predicting those features using SVM (support vector machines) and comparing that with baseline Naïve Bayes prediction models. Further, evaluation was performed using K-fold cross validation, confusion matrix (precision, recall and F-score) and Bootstrapping method.
