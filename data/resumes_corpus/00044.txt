In my current role we are tasked with implementing mission critical custom applications into the data warehouse and provide leadership into the logical and physical design of these custom applications. I also serve as not only the database administrator on these projects, but also as the point person that manages the various relationships with various teams to successful implement these objectives throughout the SDLC. In this role, we support infrastructure and development teams along with end users and business contacts.      A highlight of my career thus far is the creation of a writeback environment in our Greenplum environment that allows data scientists and data analysts to “writeback” to the production environment. In this, they are able to bring their own data and join it to data at rest in the production warehouse. I have created a tool for these people to perform advanced analytics on the fly on production data. Examples of things being done in this environment include geospatial analytics, text analytics, decision trees and time series analysis. This is my vision of data warehouses in the future, not the old reliable canned reporting, but real-time, decision quality analytics that are produced in an agile atmosphere.
