Web Developer, Mac Systems <span class="hl">Web</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span>, Mac Systems Web developer, graphic design, social media Delavan, WI I would like to promote my skills in both web development and SEO as I have almost 10 years of experience in these fields. I've been developing database-driven CMS websites since 2007 and have SEO skills as well. Website security is also a strong suit in my web  development skill set.    I have 21 years of experience in the print industry, beginning with graphic design/gloss covers in 1998 and moving through the workflow to begin the implementation of a digital commercial workflow strategy for CSI Media by 2000. This included installing and  maintaining 22 Macintosh computers, their Adobe Suites and maintaining a competitive edge with our design/prepress department.    My workflow eventually migrated to support commercial print, with responsibilities including: Customer Service, client software training (assisting customer in properly building their publications using the latest technology and more often than not, old, outdated technology),  correcting PDF files for print, sending files to the RIP and seeing the job through the workflow.    Software that I've utilized extensively over the past 21 years in prepress include:    Quark, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Acrobat Professional, Pitstop Professional, Multi-Ad Creator, Harlequin RIP, Dynastrip (imposition software)    In addition to implementing the digital workflow to plate, I have developed 4 websites for CSI Media during my tenure, with the latter three sites being developed on the Joomla CMS. The latest of these sites can be viewed at www.communityshoppers.com.    The development of the last two sites for CSI resulted in my launching Pollygrafx, LLC, (www.pollygrafx.com) a small web development company (sole proprietorship). Pollygrafx began more as a path for me to learn more about the CMS, because one website cannot prepare a person for the multitude of things that can go wrong in web development today.     Since 2007, I've developed over 65 websites utilizing the Joomla platform and have acquired several WordPress sites as well.    Software that I've utilized extensively in web development since 2007 include:    Joomla CMS, Akeeba Backup, AdminTools, K2, JCH Optimize Pro, JSitmap, JEvents, JCE Editor, BigCommerce and WordPress Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Web Developer, Mac Systems CSI Media, LLC - Delavan, WI August 1998 to Present • Macintosh Systems  • Providing budget information for software and hardware  • Digital Workflow using Adobe Acrobat Pro and Pitstop Professional  • Imposition for Computer to Plate using Dynastrip and Harlequin RIP  • Development of CSI websites using Joomla CMS  • Graphic Design using Quark, Adobe CS and Multi-Ad Creator  • Photography with Lightroom and On1 support  • Customer service (training customers on how to produce their magazines, tri-folds, etc. for print)  • Posting all editorial content to Facebook for social media presence Repair meeting facilitator Motorola 1996 to August 1998 • Circuit board repair which included working alongside the engineers  • Production line work building the first flip phones Education High school or equivalent Santa Rita High School - Tucson, AZ September 1979 to June 1983 Skills Adobe Illustrator (10+ years), Photoshop (10+ years), InDesign (8 years), Quarkxpress (10+ years), Wordpress (4 years), Joomla (10+ years), Dynastrip (10+ years), Mac OS X, Mac OS X (10+ years), Windows (10+ years), Adobe Lightroom (4 years) Certifications/Licenses WordPress Essential Training August 2016 to Present Certificate No: D0066610947A40F499D76B0790541369 Accessibility for WordPress September 2016 to Present Certificate No: 754C78503FAF4893BC1FC24BECAEAAAC WordPress Developer Tips: Locking Down WordPress September 2016 to Present Certificate No: 2F561B5D327F49D99C1414C83119C4F6 WordPress Plugins: Backing Up Your Site September 2016 to Present Certificate No: CF490A42809B46628DAA8C98F245581A Installing and Running WordPress: Shared Hosting September 2016 to Present Certificate No: 2D14A66291884B81AD7AB286ACF33CB2 SEO Tools Fundamentals June 2016 to Present Certificate No: 54D38DCCB284494197DABF4AAB890979 SEO For Local Visibility March 2015 to Present Certificate No: FC49A0606B7E4FB6B9548AD4C78D479F SEO Fundamentals February 2015 to Present Certificate No: F84CEEC9A0DC4645A7E66401C776FC95 SEO Keyword Strategy In Depth February 2015 to Present Certificate No: A1314D1DF11645B48B800AC956E8FEF8 Additional Information Skills  Skills include troubleshooting and maintaining Macintosh computers, computer installation, software installation on both PC and Mac, customer service, PDF file manipulation, graphic design, web design/development, website migration, website re-installation, website security, SEO, graphic design, magazine design and layout, prepress, prepress troubleshooting, computer installation, photography.    Software includes Joomla CMS, WordPress, Akeeba Backup, AdminTools, K2, JCH Optimize Pro, JSitmap, JEvents, JCE Editor, BigCommerce, Quark, InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Camera RAW, Acrobat Professional, Pitstop Professional, Multi-Ad Creator, Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, Affinity Publisher (all part of a design suite aimed at replacing Adobe and their annual fee), On1 Photo RAW.
