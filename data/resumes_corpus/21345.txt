This interface is responsible for moving the data to the database that vendor product interacts with.  • Played a key role in migrating the legacy loaders in to strategic loaders, which is built completely on Java8 and spring.  • Developed an UI to perform UAT loads on all the servers. Arguments passed in from the UI will be used to execute a generic load script that I created. This helped us a lot in reducing the time we take to load the data into UAT servers and at the same time reduced the turnaround time for our users.  • Created a dashboard using Angular, which would plot a linear graph of batch load timings and load times based on the date parameters.  • Created a flat file comparison service which would compare the files row by row and if matched would compare the individual columns. Once the comparison is done it would give out a detailed report about matched and unmatched results. Made this tool available to the team members by creating an UI on top of it.  • Implemented REST Microservices using spring boot.  • Worked on java 8 features.  • Migrating existing application into micro services architecture using Rest APIs, spring boot.  • Worked extensively with spring framework with modules like Spring AOP, spring core, Spring JDBC, spring batch, Spring MVC, Creating new beans and wrote loosely coupled code utilizing dependency injection.  • Played a key role in many other infrastructure uplift projects, which resulted in efficient use of our resources and improved data availability to end-users.  • Involved in supporting all of our applications and worked extensively on support reduction.  • Worked on creating secure Restful web services using JSon and Xml.  • Worked on build and deployment tools like maven, Bit bucket, Git and Jenkins.    Environment: Java 8, JSP, Struts, Restful web Services (JERSEY, Spring Boot), Hibernate, Web Services, Angular, Ajax, JQuery, Shell Scripts, Stored Procedures, SOAP web services.  Tools: Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ.
