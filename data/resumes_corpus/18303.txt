Software Developer Software <span class="hl">Developer</span> Dallas, TX I have been studying at the University of Texas at Dallas for two years. During these two years, I actively pursued my master's degree so that I won two degrees in two years - ITM and Finance. In this university, earning a degree is part of my life, but more importantly, I realize that continuous learning is the way to get a foothold in the society and the future. In one course, several Indian friends and I became a group to overcome a project. We didn’t trust each other at the beginning, and it was difficult to understand each other because of cultural differences, but it made me realize overcoming these difficulties is a must-have skill in future work. So in the first few assignments, I will actively communicate and respect the opinions of everyone in our group. When there is disagreement, we will also see the goal as the criterion to make decisions that are good for the team. Under the collision of such thoughts and cultures, we finished the great results in the end-got 98 points, and we became good friends with each other after the project. Hence, actively facing problems and learning in any environment is a valuable experience and wisdom that I have gained in this learning career.
