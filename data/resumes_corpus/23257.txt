Research Assistant Research Assistant Research Assistant Seattle, WA Work Experience Research Assistant Brown University August 2014 to August 2019 • Simulated electromagnetic scattering problems and photonic band structures using MATLAB and Python, along with numerical calculation software such as COMSOL, MEEP and MPB.  • Developed automatic data-taking systems for long-term condensed matter physics experiments  using MATLAB and LabView.  • Supervised 2 undergrad students on experiments, numerical simulations and technical writings.  • Published 22 papers in collaboration with 10+ research groups among the world.  • Presented 5 talks on IEEE and OSA conferences, and 2 invited talks at NIST and Brown University.  • Reviewed 6 papers for IEEE and OSA journals. Software Developer Institute of Physics CAS - CN May 2014 to August 2014 Developed a desktop application that supports users to design and fabricate tapered optical fibers  (a type of optical fiber that has non-uniform diameters). The product has been used by customers  for over five years. Many research results/publications are produced with the help of this software.  • Implemented backend using C++, fiber-tapering algorithm, and equipment APIs.  • Implemented frontend GUI using Visual Basic  • Leveraged knowledge in C++, Visual Basic, Windows OS, instrumental API Education Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering Brown University August 2014 to August 2019 B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Peking University August 2010 to June 2014 Skills C++, HTML, JAVASCRIPT, NODE.JS, PYTHON, FRAMEWORKS, MATLAB, CSS, TOMCAT, JAVA, SPRING, LABVIEW Links https://github.com/wei-zhang-thz
