Managed Systems Engineer Managed <span class="hl">Systems</span> Engineer Managed Systems Engineer Winter Park, FL I've been a computer pro since 1998. I've taken a couple of breaks along the way, but never have  I strayed far from the land of IT.  My five-year tenure at Amazon.com, back during their "Get Big Fast" days is a career highlight  that both challenged and thrilled me. This is where my skills were broadened and sharpened. A  hundred geek stories can be told from this period.  Another source of learning was in Microsoft's Server Performance Lab, where I wrote batch  scripts to harvest test results and update web pages to track daily trends.  After a position at Real Networks, where I was instrumental in the expansion and stabilization of  their encoder farm, I joined some old Amazon friends at their consultancy, BlueGecko.net. Here I  expanded my knowledge of Linux and Web Hosting, while providing them the ability to offer  Windows support to their clients.  As a Systems Engineer with Marchex, our small IT team handled everything from everyday  requests to start-to-finish company-wide projects, using multiple OSes. Projects included proof-  of-concept, procurement, racking and cabling, testing and implementation.  After the economic downturn that led to layoffs at Marchex, I followed my entrepreneurial spirit  into online selling. I kept my IT skills sharp by taking online courses and subscribing to tech  newsletters such as SANS.  My second position at Real Networks made excellent use of my broad set of System  Administration skills, ranging from Data Center work to Production Operations support of  crucial Real Player services.  My recent position at Cascadeo Corp. broadened my skills yet again, this time into Cloud  Infrastructure via Amazon Web Services. I am currently studying to become an AWS Certified  SysOps Administrator.  I'm an IT pro and always will be. My skills and experience will make a fine contribution to any  company.  =================================================    Tony Roberson  Systems Administrator / Engineer  https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyroberson  lowsparker@yahoo.com  206-331-9997 Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Managed Systems Engineer Cascadeo Corporation February 2015 to May 2015 Moved to Florida)  Tier II and Tier III NOC / Systems Engineer Duties included:  o AWS Configuration and Administration  o Linux and Windows Support o Diverse Cloud Businesses Supported including:  oo Gaming Site  oo Workplace Wellness Site  oo Real Time Location Sharing Site  oo Contact Information Provider Systems Administrator / Engineer Real Networks April 2012 to October 2014 Contract then Full Time Employee)  Combination of Production Systems Administration, Inventory and Data Center Management  duties, including the projects, analysis and symbioses that comes with providing this  combination of duties.  Projects included:  o HQ, Data Center and Labs move to new HQ and 2nd Data Center  o Finding and replacing all unowned Public IP's  o Updating *all* our linux systems to the latest CentOS 5 or latest CentOS 6 Systems Engineer Altogether Home February 2012 to April 2012 Short term contract)  Data Center Move Support: including building small data center from bare room to fully  functional.
