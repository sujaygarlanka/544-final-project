Senior Web Designer, UI/UX Senior Web Designer, UI/UX Senior Web Designer/ Developer Euless, TX I have a strong interest in the technical aspect of design and have a keen eye for visually stimulating design. Web design appeals to me because of the potential to enhance the design by keeping the end user in mind. I am always looking out for new trends and innovative web standards, learning how sites function and how they allow the user to interact. If there are transitions, animations or something involving interactivity, I want to know how it's done.   I have worked for clients from a broad spectrum of industries and gained knowledge to accommodate their individual web design and development needs. My experience has challenged me to stretch my comfort zones and stay up-to-date on the latest trends.  If you would like to see my work, take a look at my Behance profile: www.behance.net/trevorwest28 Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Web Designer, UI/UX Asimut Technology Solutions - Plano, TX April 2019 to Present » Design and develop a new brand identity  » Evaluate existing applications and evaluate their UX (user experience) effectiveness  » Implement existing UX & design deliverables such as prototypes, wireframes, and style guides into functioning code  » Be able to ensure that the user interface is integrated as-intended with the Back- End code  » Troubleshoot and resolve any application and user interface defects between browsers  » Update the current template to utilize a fully responsive, Bootstrap framework  » Present mock-ups to clients and walk them through the business needs for template updates and user testing examples  » Create and implement interaction models, user flows, and user interface specifications Senior Web Developer Southwest Airlines - Dallas, TX February 2018 to April 2019 » Develop and implement creative for homepage, sale landing pages, Rapid Rewards campaigns, Chase Credit Card offers, and updating multiple areas of Southwest.com to a responsive template, with new/redesigned web pages for a better user experience.   » Maintain overall design and development for .com and mobile pages.   » Work with our programming team to improve upon backend CMS, ensuring the team has a well developed work environment.   » Mentor junior teammates in growing their skills and abilities to use industry standard practices for front- end development.
