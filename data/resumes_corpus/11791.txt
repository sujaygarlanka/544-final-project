Security Officer <span class="hl">Security</span> Officer Technical Recruiter - CROSBY CORPORATION Laurel, MD "If you reveal your secrets to the wind, you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees."     I am an upcoming professional with a goal, but then again, aren’t we all? To some extent, yes; however, with my goal comes a developed plan. I aspire to enter the IT field and advance my experience and skills within cyber security.     Since I can remember, I enjoyed fixing and troubleshooting things. I later found that I can generate revenue by combining my hobbies and educational background.     My undergraduate degree in Business Administration coupled with my prospective Masters of Science in Cybersecurity provide me with an interesting dynamic to the IT industry: I can find technological solutions for clients while simultaneously branding their business, hence, “killing two birds with one stone.”    My specialties include, but are not limited to: analyzing cyber-attacks, identifying security networks by creating cyber architect to protect against systems, strategic planning, crisis solving, and intrusion detection.
