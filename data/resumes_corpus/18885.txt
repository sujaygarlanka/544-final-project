(Georgia Institute of Technology)    HealthViz is a clean & efficient health information visualization system.  Through this project, we aim to improve the efficiency of Health Information Exchange (HIE) process. The system enables efficient exchange of data from PCP and all specialists using standard CCD document. Featured by its capacity of memorizing user preferences, integrating & prioritizing health data, it sheds new light on current health information system design.  _____________________________________________________________________________    • autoVoxforge - automatic speech recognition training & testing system  - Project Designer & developer    autoVoxforge is a Python project aiming at automatically perform speech recognition and language modeling by Voxforge and Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK). This system facilitates automation is the whole process of training testing on large corpus, rather than the traditional manual way. It partially solves the problem of data normalization, which is a huge bottle neck in the whole process.   _____________________________________________________________________________    • EliTES - clinical trial Eligibility Tracing and Estimation System  - Project designer & developer    In this study, we first proposed the method of tracking clinical trial design information in predicting post-market drug performance. We focused on the eligibility focus shift between pre-market and post-market interventional drug trials and tried to assess its relationship with post-market drug performances and possible side effects. We found that it is possible to predict post-market drug performances by integrating the design of eligibility section for interventional drug trials alone, rather than waiting for trial outcome. The manuscript is under preparation.  _____________________________________________________________________________    • http://machinities.com  - Personal Project    machinities.com is the website I built as a personal project. It is the hub of my several projects including image recognition, motion detection and other AI projects. In hope of creating a open learning environment, I posted several tutorials about creating projects like that. I will come up with new project in the future, keep tuned!

However, it has become more and more clear that RNA plays more important roles than simply being the information carrier. Recently, whole genome transcriptomic analyses have identified large numbers of dynamically expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are involved in a variety of biological functions. Even so, the functions and molecular mechanisms of most lncRNAs still remain elusive. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational methods to predict the function of lncRNAs in order to accelerate the study of lncRNAs. Here, we review the recent progress in the identification of lncRNAs, the molecular functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs, and the computational methods for predicting the function of lncRNAs.
