I'm a computer enthusiast who has grown up and lived in Ohio since I was born. I started tinkering with computers from an early age and have been dreaming to work with them as a career ever since. Whether it be the hardware in the computer itself, or the object being controlled by the software from the computer, I will always be interested. I consider myself to be accel in team-based environments with high levels of communication. My weaknesses include performing new tasks without guidance. I am a very quick learner and can pick up and process new tasks with ease.
