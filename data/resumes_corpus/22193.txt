Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Oracle PL/SQL Developer Rexel USA - Addison, TX March 2019 to Present implementation. Work on requests to pull data into the Oracle database from various sources such as SQL Server or MySQL via Informatica, or to troubleshoot SQL in existing views/materialized views.    Key Tasks:  • Reverse engineer Informatica workflows in order to transfer business rules into SQL in database views.  • Developed PL/SQL procedures to parse views for dependencies in order to aid in research and determining impact of changes. Senior Software Engineer Fidelity Investments - Westlake, TX November 2011 to September 2018 Part of an Agile/Scrum team that supported and maintained multiple applications for calculating mutual fund metrics such as Net Asset Values and Mil Rates and distributing that data in the form of reports or system files to subscribers both internal and external to the company. Components for the primary application supported were written in UNIX C/C++, Pro*C/C++, Perl, Visual C++, and PowerBuilder and integrated with Oracle databases, Tuxedo, and JasperServer (with queries calling PL/SQL packages) and operational tasks executing on Control-M and HPOO.    Key Projects/Tasks:  • Developed PL/SQL stored procedures and packages for various reports. Also, some PL/SQL code were rewritten to reduce execution times from over an hour to just minutes.  • Supported Pro*C/C++ programs which extracts data from flat files, validates, transforms, and loads to the database.  • Migrated application from AIX to Linux-based hardware. Build scripts had to be rewritten and C/C++ code had to be recompiled and debugged for the the new target OS.  • Troubleshooted issues during production firecalls. Workarounds normally involved editing contents of the database directly.  • Participated in efforts to upgrade existing software to newer versions such as JasperServer which required extensive regression and performance testing. Software Developer Walmart August 2008 to September 2011 Developed and implemented solutions for detecting anomalies in customer transactions at the Walmart stores and Sam's Clubs; the most recent solution was an anti-money laundering system that is used to report suspicious activities to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). That solution required integrating an application developed by SAS into Walmart systems. Interfaces were written in UNIX Korn scripts with a few modules written in Perl and SAS. Software Developer EDS - Dallas, TX November 2006 to July 2008 Implemented enhancements and modifications to the Financial subsystem responsible for totaling transactions and producing checks sent to the medical providers. Financial must also generate reports for both Medical providers and internal accounting. Subsystem comprised of Solaris C programs with interfaces to Oracle10g databases via Embedded SQL. Programs were compiled using Sun C and Pro*C compilers along with make. Supporting scripts were written in C Shell and Korn Shell. Lucent Technologies 1999 to 2001 Developed and maintained Solaris and HPUX tools used for performing data migration. When clients request upgrades to their switching system, data from the existing version must be adjusted in order to accommodate the newer version. Since clients' systems are highly customized, data migration procedures and techniques can vary from one implementation to another - tools had to be flexible enough to be used in different situation. Utilities were written in Korn shell and C/C++ with interfaces to Oracle and Sybase using SQL and Pro*C.    DocuCorp 1997-1999  Developed custom Win32 and AIX programs to interface company's publishing software to clients' systems. Such programs read data from the native system and instructs the publishing server on how to format data into letters and forms that are printed and mailed to the clients' customers. These converter programs were written in VB, VC++, and C with interfaces to Oracle and FileNet. Electrospace (Raytheon) 1994 to 1997 Maintained and enhanced administrative software built on the Sun OpenWindows platform interfacing with Recital database applications. Maintained and enhanced the multi-treaded DSS calls processing software operating on VxWorks (real-time UNIX).
