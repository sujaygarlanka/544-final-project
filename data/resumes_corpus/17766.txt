Developer ( Python, Excel) <span class="hl">Developer</span> (<span class="hl">Python</span>, Excel) Mechanical Engineer, Software Developer San Francisco Bay Area, CA I’m a recently graduated Mechanical Engineer with a passion for Mechatronics, programming, and software development. My  concentration in Mechatronics has given me ample experience in concurrent engineering through diverse projects.  I’ve learned how to approach problems from many perspectives to find the best solution. I’ve relentlessly scoured software libraries in  an effort to arrive at final product that was not only functional, but polished, responsive, and robust. This drive has led me to  individually study software development, learning many tools along the way. I’m looking to expand and challenge my skills as an  engineer with a workplace and projects I’ll love.
