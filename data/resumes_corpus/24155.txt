I have progressed to the level of Assistant Technology Director. My role in IT introduced me to scripting to manage our fleet of Macs and got me curious about programming. I decided to pursue a degree in computer science and completed that recently. Now, in my spare time, I am focusing on specific libraries in React and learning new technologies such as AWS and GraphQL.
