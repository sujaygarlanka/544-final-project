Java and Python Tutor Java and <span class="hl">Python</span> Tutor Software Developer Las Vegas, NV I love programming, and I have a strong technical background. While working at Epic, I trained over 600 new software developers, technical support staff, and hospital IT staff in our programming framework and database management system. I also sought out software development projects, one of which earned me an award for going above and beyond.    After teaching computer science and math in public high schools, I'm looking to return to software development or another technical role that uses my programming, mathematical, and logical skills. I look forward to working with a team to create solutions for a company and its customers.
