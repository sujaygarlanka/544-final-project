DIGITAL SEAMSTRESS DIGITAL SEAMSTRESS Vancouver, WA I love that Web Development is a field that is continuously changing and evolving. It forces me to constantly discover and learn what is current. I've always loved hand crafts, so my current title of Digital Seamstress is a way to represent my passion for the intricacies of coding and making a flat design come to life. I'm born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, however I love to travel and experience other cultures. I'm fluent in Spanish and love using it in my daily life.
