Additional Information Working for an ISP covering 14 states taught me patience dealing with people on all technical levels. It has taught me how to quickly assess problems of all sizes, individual or enterprise wide. I am ready to contribute in any way I can. I stepped away in 2015 to pursue my own company, (not IT related). I can lead or follow without a problem, ready to work. My troubleshooting skills are excellent. Currently working on Security+ certification.
