Full Stack Web Developer Full Stack Web <span class="hl">Developer</span> WordPress Theme Developer Fort Lauderdale, FL Work Experience Full Stack Web Developer 30 Lines May 2017 to June 2019 For the start of my job I was working on a Public WordPress Plugin, Rent Press. It allows us to import real estate data from RentCafe, Entrata, ResMan, OnSite, And VaultWare into WordPress sites. My primary role has been identifying and organizing the data sets at play and applying new database tables and indexes. During one of my accomplishments of note is that we had directly affected page speed that was in the 3 seconds range and I optimized and reduced loading times to less than 1.25 seconds and with more data available in the foundation templates. Also I developed AngularJS Modules and Directives for each of the datasets, which has cleaned up our HTML and PHP templates, as well as cut the development time in half for most future work. This change made it possible to no longer have put database queries inside our templates and build forms that relate to database queries. As well as cutting back the amount of javascript we had to write for maps. However the past several months have been dedicated to rebuilding a laravel application that took care of the standardization of the data from the sources above. In which i was submerged in MySQL, Laravel, Backwards Compatible, and VueJS.  LINKS: https://wordpress.org/plugins/rentpress/   REFERENCES:   Derek Foster (CTO), derek@30lines.com, 239-464-4442  Ryan March (Daily Manager), ryan@30lines.com, 513-739-5403 Full Stack Web Developer Selas Tech - Fort Lauderdale, FL November 2016 to May 2017 I mostly worked on a client, Transworld, in which i built hand full of WordPress plugins and two themes, in order to create and maintain an international multi site framework.
