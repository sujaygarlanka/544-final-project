Optimal Sensor Node Placement using LIDAR Data ( Python, R, MATLAB Optimal Sensor Node Placement using LIDAR Data (<span class="hl">Python</span>, R, MATLAB Berkeley, CA Ready for hire **immediately** in the bay area. I also do contract work remotely, if you'd like or prefer that. Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Optimal Sensor Node Placement using LIDAR Data ( Python, R, MATLAB SNRI Sierra Nevada Research Institute - Berkeley, CA January 2015 to Present Given a LIDAR image, optimal locations for snow depth sensors were determined considering tradeoffs between number of sensor nodes, connectivity within the wireless sensor network, and evenly-sensed  domain.  - K-folds cross validation was used to determine efficacy of node locations.  - Convex optimization in MATLAB (using quadprog) was used to determine sensor node locations that  maintain wireless connectivity Python Developer Self-employed, contract work - Berkeley, CA January 2015 to Present Programmed an object-oriented optimization program that optimally assigns requests to the appropriate  cloud, and host base on availability, and distance from request.  - Instructed undergraduate students, and working professionals, both one-one and in a classroom setting on the following:  o Data structures and efficient algorithms (in theory, and Python/C/Matlab implementation)  o Preparing for technical interviews in software engineering, and data analysis Statistical Analyst for Geospatial data (R and Python) Geostatistics Estimation and Simulation (R) December 2014 to Present Used R to analyze real-world, sparse environmental data  o Used EDA techniques to determine spatial relationships between variables (covariance models,  cross-correlation etc.)  o Used estimation methods on the residuals (co-kriging, ordinary kriging, IDW) of the models to cross-validate, sometimes using the jackknife or leave-one-out method when there was very  sparse data.  o Used conditional and unconditional simulations, sometimes involving indicator variables, to evaluate scenarios such as changes in groundwater levels, temperature, and contaminants. Python Data Analysis Developer KA Lite Inc. - Berkeley, CA June 2014 to August 2014 Used pandas and matplotlib to visualize data for instructors using KA Lite  - Integrated data visualization with existing django applications  - Collaborated remotely with developers around the world using github Research Assistant ( Python) Decision Algorithm for Schedule Optimization (Python) - Lewisburg, PA June 2013 to August 2013 Applied OOP simulation to the pumping schedules of water utility companies, using real-world data  -Design Considerations: Algorithmic complexity, computation/accuracy tradeoffs, data visualization.  -Input is csv file of projected water demand, output is figures, and optimized schedule.  -Evaluating the usefulness of the algorithm using data from York Water Company in Pennsylvania  -Pursued this project as an entrepreneurial pursuit, funded by the Reed-Garman Entrepreneurship award (see Education Masters in Systems Engineering University of California - Berkeley - Berkeley, CA B.S. in Environmental Engineering Bucknell University Skills C/C++, Python, R, Matlab, Linux, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, ALL Microsoft Office Software, git Links http://github.com/jormak27 Additional Information TECHNICAL SKILLS  -Very skilled: R, MatLab, Python, git (username: jormak27)  -Experienced: C/C++, PHP, Bash scripting, Windows, Linux, Socket programming, LabView, PSoC creator  - Python Libraries used: pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, django, scikit-learn  -Programming concepts: hashmaps, trees, recursion, circular queues, algorithmic complexity, mutex locks,  interrupt vectors, unit testing, pointers,  -Mathematical concepts: linear algebra, bayesian statistics, spatial statistics, geostatistics, stochastic  processes, time series analysis, state estimation, parameter identification, convex optimization, support vector  machines,
