Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Front End Developer College of Innovation and Design - Boise, ID August 2016 to May 2019 In this position I worked with agile teams, developers, UX designers, and artists in order to produce assets in C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS languages. I effectively communicated ideas to team members, and clients. I implemented UI for mobile, web, desktop, and AR/VR applications; taking the project from beginning brainstorm to final release. I used Unity, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign, XD, and Git in order to engage first time users, as well as keeping current ones. I participated in team meetings, spoke at conferences, and wrote research papers. I led teams to successful completion of unique projects, and looked for strengths within my team members. I’m extremely proud of the work we did, especially in the case of the NASA SUITS project (ask me! I’d love to show you the basics!), and look forward to creating meaningful experiences that bring people together.
