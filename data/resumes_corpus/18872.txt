YAVIS - My Personal Assistant ( Python, IBM Watson Conversation) YAVIS - My Personal Assistant (<span class="hl">Python</span>, IBM Watson Conversation) Teaching Assistant - Apache Spark Rochester, NY I am currently in my last semester working towards my thesis on using natural language processing for financial forecasting. I have worked as an intern at Amazon.com where I developed a robot with the entire framework from scratch using Java and added pattern recognition to it. The robot was extensible and scalable to a high extent, and I used DynamoDB to save the data.    I also interned at Conduent Inc., which was Xerox when I interviewed with them My title over there was Summer Researcher ? Process Automation and Optimization Scientist, where I created a data dictionary to understand the data, cleaned the data accordingly and then generated reports on web apps using R that would give more insight on my how the employees are working.    I have been to a few hackathons and, in one of them I came up with the idea of a Quote wallpaper generator which takes an image uses Google's Vision API gets the highest confidence element, goes through a dataset of quotes, locates a related quote and pastes it on the image processed and outputs a wallpaper. I developed this application in a team of three people and we used Java to develop the application.    Lastly, I have a strong understanding of Python as well and have developed projects for my school courses using Python. Some of the projects include clustering algorithms: k-Means, hierarchical clustering, a data science tweak for Otsu's and also decision trees and bi-gram and tri-gram detection. I have a good grasp on Machine Learning algorithms and I am currently taking a certificate course taught by Dr. Andrew Ng from Stanford on Coursera. I have also finished my Advanced Certification in Big Data Analytics from Rochester Institute of Technology.
