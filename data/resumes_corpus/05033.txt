It’s easy to subscribe to this mindset and let cynicism take hold.  Why are we Governed? http://thepoliticsoffacts.com/why-are-we-governed/ 2019-04 Why are we governed? Where does the right to govern the American people emanate from? By what authority does the Government derive it’s power to govern? Can life exist without Government? Can our rights be protected without the presence of Government authority? Religious Pluralism & the Christian Right http://thepoliticsoffacts.com/religious-pluralism-and-the-christian-right/ 2019-06 According to the United States Declaration of Independence, the founding father of the growing American nation set forth on a journey to pave a new path of freedom and liberty by which the young nation was to be guided. This path, guarded by “unalienable rights” which the declaration asserts, “where endowed by their Creator”, are natural rights given, bestowed upon and divinely prescribed for every individual.  Original Intent: The Separation of Church and State http://thepoliticsoffacts.com/original-intent-the-separation-of-church-and-state/ 2019-05 The original intent of the founding fathers while crafting the religious clauses of the first amendment was to establish a clear and distinct separation of the church and state. A wall of separation purposely designed to protect the state from the church and the church from the state.  Additional Information (Web Design - Front End Web Development - Graphic Design)    HTML5, CSS3, LESS, SASS, SCSS, Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, jQuery, JavaScript, React,  Node, NPM, Yarn, Webpack, Babel, MongoDB, Mongoose, Visual Studio Code, SVN, GIT,  GitHub, GitBash, Jira, Experience working in an Agile/Scrum development process.    Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Flash, InDesign, Premiere, After Effects, Wireframes,  Mock-Ups, MS Office Suite, Final Cut Pro, Motion, Sound Track Pro, Compressor, Cinema  4D, Digital & Print Media    SKILLS CURRENTLY MASTERING: (Back End - Full Stack Development)    Vue.js, Express.js, Angular, JSON, AJAX, API's, MEAN Stack (Mongo DB, Express.js, Angu-  lar.js, Node.js), LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache Web Server, MySQL, PHP)
