Conducted a technology research and developed well-structured, N-Tier, domain-driven application design. Was steadily applying modern functional techniques (extension methods, lambda expressions, LINQ.)  • Developed a technique for a secure data exchange between ASP.NET and legacy ASP pages. Worked on a custom single sign-on module for CoTs Intranet.  • In maintaining a legacy codebase, introduced more structured approach of reusable functions located in ASP include files.  • As the single most important achievement, designed from scratch and developed custom permission system for CoTs Intranet. The complex and highly granular permission logic of CoTs Intranet was initially hard-coded into ASP pages, making it unmanageable. Over a year of research and development I created a new system called Roles and Rights Management System (RRM), database-driven and based on fundamental notions of a Role, a Right (permission), and a Scope. It included an administrative interface and made it easy to maintain CoTs Intranet permissions. I was given Employee Of The Quarter award for creating the system.  Environment: C#, ASP.NET, VBScript, ASP, SQL, JavaScript, HTML. SQL Server, MS Access, custom .NET libraries. VS 2012, IIS, TFS.
