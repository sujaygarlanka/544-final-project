PROGRAM MANAGER PROGRAM MANAGER PROGRAM MANAGER New York, NY Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience PROGRAM MANAGER BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON - Jersey City, NJ June 2017 to August 2017 • Wrote a series of Python Application programs to essentially systemize a data remediation project which was outstanding for over three years. The bank was assigning a significant number of resources to generate, analyze, validate, edit, modify and ultimately remediate the incomplete and erroneous Tri-Party account data. This entailed the generation of various account pre-database CSV files using algorithms developed to automate with Python applications which was essentially being done manually.  • This project was complete ahead of schedule and under budget it was originally anticipated to be completed at the end of the first quarter 2018, the suite of applications developed and implemented enabled all the data remediation and file conversions to be completed in August 2017. Given the success of this project I was asked to develop a similar suite of python programming tools for the BNY Mellon US Treasury clearance system which prior were not cleared through BNY Mellon. This enabled BNY Mellon to become the sole clearinghouse for the three remaining Primary Treasury Dealers with the integration of JP Morgan's Treasure clearing business as JP Morgan according to information available publicly, transferred their Treasure Security Clearance business to BNY Mellon who is now the only clearing broker for all 20 Primary Treasure Dealers.
