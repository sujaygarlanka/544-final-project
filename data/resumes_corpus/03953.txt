These projects are of many different stacks including AEM 6+, Angular 2, and React. Being in an agency environment enables me to do more than enough learning on the job as we are regularly tasked with unconventional issues & goals. At Infield best practices are a must and we review every commit in hopes of improving our work and growing as developers while helping our teammates to do the same. FRONT- END DEVELOPER BRIGHT STORES, INC - Denver, CO February 2016 to January 2017 As a member of the Front- End Team at Bright Stores I was able to build e-commerce ( think fork of Shopify ) solutions for companies all across the United States, Canada, and Australia. I was able to bring in modern development practices to the company such as git, code reviews, scss, modern build tools, and a general concern for optimization & performance.  Working with the company president I helped institute a developer learning schedule which included exploring new technologies and pair-programming for knowledge transfer as well as problem solving. DIRECTOR DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT - Denver, CO December 2012 to February 2016 Built, designed, and managed over 30 websites for CAP Management and all of their clients.  At CAP I was able to lead all aspects of my projects for which I was able to really grow and build my self-sufficient skillset.    CURRENTLY WORKING WITH • AEM   • Angular 2   • React   • Webpack   • Gulp   • Foundation   • Flexbox   • SCSS   • BEM   • jQuery   • HTL ( HTML Template Language ) FRONT- END DEVELOPER SUBLIME DIGITAL - Denver, CO January 2014 to December 2014 At Sublime Digital I moved away from design and became strictly a front- end developer role where I was able to realize my true passion in development. I worked with design firms ( mainly in the liquor industry ) to build out the front- end of their client facing web projects. I parted ways with the company amicably as I was not confident in the longevity of the company and I was proven correct as the owners left the company for positions elsewhere.  Note: The Sublime Digital I worked for is not https://sublime-digital.com Education Associate Skills Javascript, Angular, UI, Front End, React Links http://pebutler3.com https://github.com/pebutler3 https://www.linkedin.com/in/pebutler3
