My main responsible is framework related development. We have 3 developers, 1 business analist. We worked mainly with core java in framework. Our framework is developed in-house. But framework originally was Spring. We, manage and create the object with inversion of control. Then injected for objects, we used dependency injection. Also we have got a lot of integrations with other government institutions. Generally we used Spring Rest Services. Our database was Oracle. We used native JDBC and Hibernate together. We used for building Maven or Jenkins, Some projects build with Maven, some projects build with Jenkins.    Technologies I used; Core Java, Spring IOC, Dependency Injection, AOP, Service Based Programming, Web Services(Rest Controllers produce both consume), Spring Boot, Hibernate, JDBC, Oracle, Maven, Jenkins, Bootstrap, Vue.JS, Jquery Software Developer Turkish Telecom - ANKARA, TR June 2008 to March 2014 • Provided user requirements analysis, design and programming support for enhancement of Web application accessed by 10 million users in Turkey.  • Coded web based interfaces using Java, Mysql, ASP.NET MVC, Jquery, T-SQL, Microsoft SQL Server.  • Designed technical presentations in coordination with internal and external partners.  • Direct software design and development while remaining focused on client needs.  • Designed mssql/mysql database for the transaction and backend data processing of the system.  • I developed a lot of call center software interfaces for agents, software integrations with other telecommunication operators, so my company could save money as high as more than 1 million USD in a year.
