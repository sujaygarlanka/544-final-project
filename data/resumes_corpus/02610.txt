I then moved to being a PC Technician in my self employed business, where I picked up expertise in computer software, hardware, and systems administration to assist clients. In all my occupations, I had to adapt to a new field, industry, and role. After moving to the United States, I learned the local culture and the local norms in a matter of months.
