To see people interact with and have fun using things I make.   To do something new, something different,  not the same old thing.    Part business, part creative, and part developer,  I bring unique insights and perspectives to problems. Understanding and balancing the technical needs and limits with the business goals and requirements   of a project while maintaining healthy relationships with clients and co-workers.
