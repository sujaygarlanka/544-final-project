BUSINESS MANAGER CERTIFICATION Frei Chevrolet Inc 2017 to 2017 Business Manager Certification General Motors 2017 to 2017 This is a very diverse position. I began as a receptionist, and had many basic duties such as office work, greeting customers, various other randomly assigned tasks. I was promoted to support the Finance Department for my efforts at the dealership and was to support the finance department and ensure that all documentation was completed correctly before being sent to financing, printing deal documentation, working under Tom Erickson and Mike Angeli training with Dave Cottis on after-market sales of services and protection plans. I would at times fill in for Finance Managers if they were on vacation and work with customers on cash deals, finances and leases. At this point I was then promoted to Dealership Administrator and was a pseudo helper for every department, but my main focus was in finance with the finance managers. Ensured customers had a clear understanding of rebates, services, warranties, and promotions being offered, documentation needed for regulatory filing and the SOS. I would also procure marketing materials for the dealership due to my proficiency with Windows Vista/10. I also managed the receptionist desk during my time as dealership admin as was responsible for wages, hiring, interviews, and essentially human resource-like activities.
