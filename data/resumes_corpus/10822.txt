Certifications/Licenses Certified Authorization Professional (CAP) The Certified Authorization Professional (CAP) course is designed for the information security practitioner who supports system security commensurate with an organization's mission and risk tolerance, while meeting legal and regulatory requirements. The CAP certification course conceptually mirrors the NIST system authorization process in compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III. Led by an (ISC)² authorized instructor, the CAP training seminar provides a comprehensive review of information systems security concepts and industry best practices, covering the seven domains of the CAP CBK: Risk Management Framework (RMF), Categorization of Information Systems, Selection of Security Controls, Security Control Implementation, Security Control Assessment, Information System Authorization, and Monitoring of Security Controls. The CAP certification is an objective measure of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for personnel involved in the process of authorizing and maintaining information systems. Specifically, this credential applies to those responsible for formalizing processes used to assess risk and establish security requirements and documentation; which ensure that information systems possess security commensurate with the level of exposure to potential risk and damage to assets or individuals.   CompTIA Security+ CE International, vendor-neutral DoDD 8570 IAT Level II certification, that proves competency in system security, cryptography, network infrastructure, access control and organizational security.
