Senior Front End Developer Senior <span class="hl">Front</span> <span class="hl">End</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Software Engineer McKinney, TX I have experience spanning both Back End and Front End development in environments built upon LAMP and MEAN technologies with varying frameworks. I have experience in migrating existing codebases from one technology to another, and have migrated a Front End environment from PHP to Typescript and Angular.    I am able to shift between REST APIs, CLI commands, and Front End asynchronous applications using RXJS and Promises. I also have experience in building websocket applications requiring constant tracking of global states using Redis and Socket.IO for communication.    I am adaptable and willing to learn new technologies as the task requires it and I believe strongly that not everything can be solved by the same technology. There is a time and a place to use each tool you have and to stick to one language and one pattern is not always the best thing for you and others.    Primary Focus: Angular    I have been heavily invested in Angular 2~8 over the past few years and have grown as a developer along side the framework. Much has changed in Angular but many familiar aspects remain the same. It's always a learning experience finding newer and better ways to approach Front End problems using such an opinionated framework. There is always something to learn when working in a framework that has a heavy community backing and frequent updates. Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Front End Developer HomeCEU - Plano, TX September 2015 to Present I have completely re-engineered the Front End of our application, which was originally using an outdated PHP framework called Kohana, and used Angular and NestJS to house all client and server components involved with the Front End specific tasks.    We did this in order to Isolate our main Back End application as a RESTful API. Jr Web Developer DMP Investments - Texarkana, TX April 2013 to September 2015 I developed multiple web sites and built an employee portal to report on statistics and process loan applications for customers seeking payday/title loans.
