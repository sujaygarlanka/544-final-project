I have a broad range of knowledge, including systems administration, network monitoring and management, backup and disaster recovery, project management, OS and messaging system migrations, and client/server hardening. I am a hands-on, IT professional. I contribute a vision and roadmap for the company/s technology needs; I then manage the planning, implementation, documentation and ongoing support. I try to make thoughtful changes that benefit the stability of the network/domain infrastructure and the productivity of each team, according to their needs. I am looking for a full time position at a company where I can share my knowledge as a Microcomputer Technician/System Engineer and to also grow in this field. I am always looking for the latest Technical advancement to further my knowledge in the IT Field and to keep up with the ever changing Technical world. I am writing to request about a position in your company, At this time of my carrier I'm seeking a full time position, I feel that it is important for me to maintain a practical real-world perspective while developing my future Engineering /Networking skills, in the company I am working with/for. I pride myself in intense problem solving and not just the easy way out; oversee computer networks to ensure that they function smoothly. A network consists of a grouping of computers that communicate with each other or a central computer known as a server, on which computer files, programs, and other information are stored. I can easily make sense of complex issues and take an unusually creative approach to solving problems. My strengths also make me a visionary. I am able to come up with lots of new and creative ideas. I have provided day-to-day supervision, conduct performance appraisals, and delegate work assignments for all IT personnel.

In the Leadership role, responsible for setting direction and ensuring consistent customer satisfaction as it relates to IT service delivery to internal staff and to ensure internal staff receive expedient technical support with significant focus on the overall customer experience. Having said all this, I realize that your first consideration in hiring an applicant must weight on the years of experience, and as you can tell I have 19 years' experience, but do have the hunger and drive to learn and to succeed in any and all that I do. In closing I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you how I might best assist your company in its present needs, I would like very much to setup a time and date for an interview.    Salary histories.  CCSF ADP-Adult Probation Department= Starting 101,000, (CA)  Pacific Partner Management Services= Starting 89,000, Ending 99,000 (CA)  San Francisco AIDS Foundation Starting = 87,000, Ending 89,000 (CA)  Affymetrix Inc.
