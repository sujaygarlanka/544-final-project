IT Manager IT Manager IT Manager - American Foundry Group Bixby, OK Passionate technologist with experience in leading IT to encourage change and growth. I enjoy motivating and inspiring those around me to experience technology in a way that improves day to day experiences. Through my experience and industry contacts I manage a clear in-depth understanding of emerging technologies so as to stay current and relevant as the business needs new innovation.  I find it key to have a clear strategy and mission when approaching the IT business unit just as is necessary for all aspects of a company. I treat IT not as projects or tasks but as ongoing programs and systems; always push, challenge, and change because the moment you fail to innovate you fail to improve and if you fail to improve, you fail.    • Certified RFID Associate from RFID Professional Institute  • Delivers clear, concise, and modern strategies for continued growth  • Embrace, encourage, and lead changes that benefits others personally and professionally  • Communicates well through written and verbal communication  • Ability to create IT solutions for business needs and process challenges  • Displays ongoing growth of knowledge to continue to adapt to the changing technological landscape Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience IT Manager American Foundry Group - Bixby, OK January 2008 to Present • Design, maintain, improve infrastructure for machines, computers, network, and communication  • Oversee, review, and audit IT security software, hardware, and test those technologies to ensure latest threats are prevented  • Manage, lead, and train IT staff including power user teams to augment IT support without IT budget impact  • Create business innovation opportunities through new leading technologies such as Hybrid Cloud, Hyperconvergence, VDI, IoT, RFID, and constantly reviewing emerging applicable technologies  • Member of SFSA (Steel Founders' Society of America) IoT Committee  • Manage multiple vendor and IT service provider relationships, maintain SLA's, annually stayed under budget  • Implement, design, and continual improvement of business processes, workflows, and ERP  • Design SharePoint and Teams Sites for internal and external collaboration Network Administrator The Price Companies - Monticello, AR September 2005 to January 2008 • Implemented and maintained WAN for 24 locations worldwide  • Managed helpdesk operations  • Implemented ERP solution in multi-location multi database environment  • Migrated from legacy to virtualized computing  • Managed vendor relationships, contracts, and purchase agreements Network and Systems Administrator/Consultant Tiner Electronics - Monticello, AR January 2000 to September 2005 • Designed and built system and network infrastructures per the requirements of the client  • Consistently achieved and exceeded sales goals  • Worked with clients to build their networks and systems to meet their business needs with a view to future growth and expansion  • Implemented network security hardware and software for multiple clients and maintained it remotely Education High School Diploma Brookhaven High School 1996 Certifications/Licenses RFID Professional Institute Certified RFID Associate April 2018 to Present
