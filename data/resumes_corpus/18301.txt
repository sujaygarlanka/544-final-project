Machine Learning Scientist Machine Learning Scientist Machine Learning Scientist - Data Science Lab, Applied Mathematics, UW Seattle, WA Driven data scientist with 4 years of experience, patent inventor, highly skilled University of Washington, Seattle   in machine/deep learning, big data, statistics, and data-driven modeling. 425-918-2114 rouzbeh@uw.edu github/Rouzbehe Work Experience Machine Learning Scientist Data Science Lab, Applied Mathematics, UW - Seattle, WA January 2019 to Present Project 1: Novel material discovery and design using machine learning, deep learning and big data analyses Data Scientist, Co-Op Norfolk Southern - Atlanta, GA July 2018 to January 2019 Project 1: Future defect/behavior prediction in transportation network and locomotives (Big Data project) • Developed a pipeline to ingest, clean, aggregate, filter, and merge the stream of data from different datasets (over 70  Million sensor/log data).  • Enhanced the performance of current machine learning models up to 5 % by applying various ensemble learning, feature engineering and dimensionally reduction techniques.  Project 2: Categorizing/analyzing customer's feedback data and technical reports using text mining/NLP • Developed, an end-to-end pipeline to clean, summarize, extract features and classify text data (over 10 million text data) using machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning techniques.  • Yielded 6% classification accuracy improvement through optimizing random forest/gradient boosting tree models.  Project 3: Anomaly detection in time history data to predict future defects in daily transportation • Collaborated actively with data science team to develop different machine/deep learning models to detect anomalies. Python/Data Visualization Developer, Internship Sailful Bouquet Co - Los Angeles, CA June 2015 to August 2015 Developed several programs by Python/MATLAB to post process and visualize the raw results of design software. Different codes developed to automate, improve and check the design procedure to remove manual design procedure. Education M.
