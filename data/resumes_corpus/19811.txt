Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience SENIOR INVESTMENT ANALYST/ BACK-END PYTHON DEVELOPER Radford University SMIPO Fund - Radford, VA February 2015 to Present Partly manage a $2 million small/mid-cap value fund for the Radford University Endowment Fund Office and Board of Directors/Alumni. I am managing director of the real estate sector within the fund where I, along with my junior analysts, manage $200,000 in equities (mainly REITs).    Aside from my role as lead analyst in the real estate sector, I am also currently working on developing an automated company valuation program, which will replace the old excel workbooks that currently take an analyst 3-4 hours to complete. Automating our investment workbook will save the analysts countless hours and will allow them to immediately compare companies. The next step in the project is to develop a local database that will compare the valuation workbooks of all U.S. equities in order to actively rank them day after day by their fundamentals (PE, PEG, CAPM, PB, FCF, EPS Growth, DCF, DDM, etc.). This will help give analysts new investment ideas that they might not come to otherwise. The end goal of the project is to make the research and analytics team more productive and to make the overall fund more competitive. The project is written in Python and MySQL, and also includes Visual Basic.
