Web Developer <span class="hl">Web</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Web Developer Lehi, UT I love the web development industry because there is never a shortage of new things to learn. Taking an unsolved problem and creating a real-world solution is one of the most satisfying feelings there is. There's a huge sense of accomplishment in taking an idea and turning it into something tangible that anyone on earth can visit on the web. That is why I chose to pursue web development.    JAVASCRIPT | REACT | NODE | HTML | CSS | SOCKET.IO | EXPRESS | AXIOS | REDUX    portfolio - https://www.derekwoodbury.dev  Github - https://www.github.com/derekwoodbury0 Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Web Developer DevMountain - Lehi, UT May 2019 to August 2019 ?
