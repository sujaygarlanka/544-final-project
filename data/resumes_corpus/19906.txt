Publications ORGANIZE EVENTS MOBILE APPLICATION https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/etd/772/ 2018-12 Abstract  In a big organization there are many events organized every day. To know about the events, we typically need to check an events page, rely on flyers or on distributed pamphlets or through word of mouth. To register for an event a user now a days typically does this online which involves inputting user details. At the event, the user either signs a sheet of paper or enters credentials in a web page loaded on a tablet or other electronic device. Typically, this is a time-consuming process with many redundancies like entering user details every time the user wants to register for a new event and re-entering the details at the event. This project designs a system that eliminates these redundancies and improves event management.
