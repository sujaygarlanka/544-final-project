Web Developer <span class="hl">Web</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Johnston, IA I have studied Full-Stack Web Development through DMACC for 2 and a half years. Much of my experience involves working with the front-end with a little back-end sprinkled in there. I have a pretty good handle on HTML, CSS/CSS3/Responsive Design, Javascript, and PHP/PDO/SQL. I have also worked with preprocessors such as SASS and have worked with CMS's such as Wordpress and Drupal. I am always willing to learn and research new technologies. I am totally willing to listen and learn from others who want to share some input. Like my dad always says, "A smart person speaks, but a wise person will listen."
