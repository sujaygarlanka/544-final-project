I have been responsible for producing and controlling technical reports  containing engineering specifications, design drawings, cost estimates and technical data  for nuclear programs and projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the  Nevada Test Site (NTS). I have developed engineering, construction and safety  documentation for the Chemistry and Metallurgical Research Replacement (CMRR) Project,  Technical Area 55 Reinvestment Project (conceptual, preliminary and final design), the  Radiography Project at TA-55, and the Nuclear Materials Safeguards and Security  Upgrades Project (NMSSUP - Phase II) at LANL. I have been responsible for ensuring that  all documents are properly formatted and written in accordance with company procedures,  customer requirements and DOE directives.  I have worked in team environments, reporting directly to company presidents, vice-  presidents, project managers, technical representatives, safety analysts, subject matter  experts, estimators and engineers. I have tailored technical documentation, under direction  of the project manager, analysts and engineers, to be compliant with DOE G 420.1-1, DOE  M 413.3, and DOE STD 3009. I have prepared technical specifications that meet NQA-1  requirements and that are compliant with the CSI 2004 format and numbering systems. In  performing my document development duties, I have recognized that I am required to verify  technical requirements with cognizant managers and engineers. Working on projects  involving Hazard Category 2 Nuclear Facilities and Category 1 special nuclear material, I  have been accountable for following DOE and NNSA safeguards and security policies  involving the handling of Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI).  I have developed and maintained logs to control incoming documents (e.g., drawings,  specifications, analyses, reports), ensuring that outgoing document packages are properly  assembled and complete. I have been responsible for preparing and distributing both hard  copy and electronic deliverable packages to the customer, stakeholder and project teams.  On the TA-55 Reinvestment Project, I developed a comprehensive MSExcel spreadsheet  that inventoried and cataloged existing gloveboxes at TA-55 to establish a documented  basis for the planned seismic qualification and upgrade subproject, which required me to  contact numerous subject matter experts while populating the spreadsheet. I have also been  responsible for maintaining program and project correspondence and transmittal logs and  maintaining electronic documentation archives. On the CMRR project I developed a  comprehensive transmittal log documenting completion of a major phase of the project that  cross-walked each deliverable package against the related contract commitment (i.e., work  breakdown structure deliverable descriptions).  As a Technical Writer/Editor, Document Specialist, and Database Administrator I have been  responsible for the following:  • Assembling and verifying completeness of documentation packages in accordance with  company and customer requirements  • Assigning documentation numbers using company and customer protocols  • Maintaining correspondence and document distribution logs  Jonathan Andrews•505-603-4920•jonandrews79@gmail.com  • Technical editing and formatting of reports and analyses in MSWord  • Creating report and specification templates for use of project team members in MSWord  • Converting MSWord, MSExcel and AutoCAD files to provide comprehensive completed  reports in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format (with set book marking by chapter, section,  appendix, etc)  • Tailoring material and equipment specifications to meet defined client requirements  • Maintaining record of review documentation including monitoring completion status,  collection and organization of completed comment forms  • Interfacing with customer Subcontract Technical Representative(s) to collect and  distribute Subject Matter Expert (SME) review comments to cognizant contractor  engineer(s) for disposition  • Maintaining record of comment dispositions and forwarding the record forms back to the  SMEs with revised engineering documentation to obtain concurrence  • Document control and document archiving on secure servers to meet NQA-1  requirements  • Verifying and documenting completeness of documentation relative to contract  commitments and WBS dictionary deliverable requirements prior to submittal  • Updating and maintaining databases by populating tables, designing queries, generating  forms, and compiling reports Work Experience Database Administrator SM Stoller Corporation - Las Vegas, NV May 2009 to September 2010 Technical Writer/Editor Risk Technologies - Albuquerque, NM March 2008 to February 2009 Technical Writer/Editor DMJM H&N / AECOM - Los Alamos, NM November 2007 to February 2008 Project Staff Assistant Burn & Roe - Los Alamos, NM December 2005 to November 2007 Technical Writer/Editor Jacobs Engineering - Los Alamos, NM October 2005 to December 2005 Technical Editor Q Consulting Service - Los Alamos, NM August 2005 to October 2005 Education B.
