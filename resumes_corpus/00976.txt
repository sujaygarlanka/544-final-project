IT Database Admin Senior IT <span class="hl">Database</span> Admin Senior IT Database Admin Senior - Foundation Health Partners Livingston, TX As part of the Foundation Health Partners (FHP) Information Technology group, I have continued to apply the skills learned at the University of Alaska Foundation to make significant performance and data integrity improvements. With the creation of a Meaningful Use dashboard, I was able to assist Tanana Valley Clinic in meeting the government guidelines with a 100% completion rate for the last 5 years. Currently, I have almost 200 reports running against 12 different systems through SQL Server Reporting Services. I have also written several SQL Server Integration Services projects to move data into and out of several SQL systems.    As I transitioned into the database administrator role, I have taken over system management for the three NextGen systems for FHP, performing multiple different upgrades including SQL, software, service and system upgrades. As part of the system upgrades, we transitioned from a single SQL Server into a SQL Cluster, dramatically reducing downtimes for maintenance while increasing the reliability and performance of the SQL system. During the Windows XP to Windows 7 transition, I moved the NextGen systems from local installed clients to Citrix presented applications, reducing the management overhead of maintaining individual installations while increasing performance for end users.    In 2017, our organization transitioned to become an independent health organization. During this transition, I successfully combined 70+ SQL servers into 6 SQL clusters, reducing licensing costs by almost 3 million dollars while increasing reliability and performance. I also assisted in the seamless transition of multiple systems, servers, desktops, and devices from one domain to the other.    Since the transition, I have continued to make performance improvements to the SQL Server systems, including: upgrading all NextGen service servers to Windows Server 2016; upgrading all NextGen citrix servers to Windows Server 2016; and moving all database storage to SSD storage.
