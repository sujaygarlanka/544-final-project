Agile development approach (scrum).  Friend Locator / Front-End Software Developer Lead Front-End development team Santa Cruz, CA 2016 to 2016 for an IOS and Android social media app  that connects friends through their location. Used React Native and MongoDB.  Agile development approach (scrum). Software Engineer Climb and Seek - Scotts Valley, CA 2015 to 2016 Created multiple web crawlers that scraped data for 77000+ rock climbing  locations in the US. Uses Python and Scrapy for the data aggregation pipeline, and a MySQL datacenter. Lead UCSC Game Development - Santa Cruz, CA 2014 to 2016 for 3D modeling and animation on two year-long game development  teams, the larger with fourteen developers. The development cycle focused on agile methodologies and utilized the scrum framework. Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic / Python, Tensorflow RECOGNITION - Santa Cruz, CA 2014 to 2016 Santa Cruz, CA  Horror Stories won a year long contest, beating over twenty other teams. Eye of the Giant was nominated for best visual art, peer choice, and greatest technical  achievement awards.    PAPER CycleGAN / Python, Tensorflow  IMPLEMENTATIONS arXiv:1703.10593v4  * In-depth descriptions below Forget gated Peephole LSTM / Python, PyTorch  arXiv:1503.04069v1  Proximal Policy Optimization / Python, Tensorflow  arXiv:1707.06347v2  Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic / Python, Tensorflow  arXiv:1602.01783v2  Adam Optimizer / Python, PyTorch  arXiv:1412.6980v9  Deep Q-Network / Python, Tensorflow  arXiv:1312.5602v1    PAPER DESCRIPTIONS CycleGAN / Python, Tensorflow  arXiv:1703.10593v4  Performs image-to-image translation in an semi-unsupervised manner: given  two unpaired datasets, the model can transform pictures of horses to zebras,  apples to oranges, or paintings to real-life. Learns to map back and forth between two domains.    Forget gated Peephole LSTM / Python, PyTorch  arXiv:1503.04069v1  Used pytorch to develop a text generator that reflects style of input corpus.  Learns long term dependencies by adding or removing information based on previous data.    Proximal Policy Optimization / Python, Tensorflow  arXiv:1707.06347v2  Learns to perform a task optimally in a 2D or 3D environment, this algorithm  replaced both Trust Region Policy Optimization and Asynchronous Advantage  Actor Critic. Leverages distributed training and is highly scalable. A modified  version of this algorithm was used for the OpenAI Five Dota 2 agents.    Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic / Python, Tensorflow  arXiv:1602.01783v2  This is the precursor to Proximal Policy optimization; the algorithm leverages a distributed, semi-scalable model framework to solve tasks in 2D or 3D  environments.    Adam Optimizer / Python, PyTorch  arXiv:1412.6980v9  A first-order gradient-based optimizer for stochastic objective functions.    Deep Q-Network / Python, Tensorflow  arXiv:1312.5602v1  The first major success of deep reinforcement learning, this learns a task by observing raw pixel input.
