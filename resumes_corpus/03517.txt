Web Graphics Designer Web Graphics Designer Front End Developer - UI Designer Washington, DC I’ve been designing just about everything ever since I was introduced to Adobe Creative Suites in 2009. I simply chose web development because it was the highest paying technological art medium and I enjoy that I’m learning a new language and designing simultaneously. After many years of making websites, I’ve developed other skills like video editing, graphic design and audio design. I do consider myself a professional and a multimedia virtuoso. I have held positions at major institutions my entire career. I produce at very high level and should be treated as such.
