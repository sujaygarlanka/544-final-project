Software Developer <span class="hl">Software</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Technical problem solver Marion, OH I like solving problems people think are impossible to solve. I take problems on methodically and systematically until a solution is found. If I don't know how something can be done or fixed I will clearly state so and explain I will go to whatever length needed to educate myself on the issue and find the resolution. I am good at explaining problems with other experts and do not have any excessive feeling of pride that can be counter productive. I am good at consulting and not promising the impossible. I know when to say "I will need to get back to you on that". I believe in self discipline and honesty.
