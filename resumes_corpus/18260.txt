Python Developer <span class="hl">Python</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Programer/Data Analysis Austin, TX When I first earned my M.S. in mathematics, I started teaching at Austin Community College. I quickly realized I wanted more than to just be a professor. I went back so school and learned some C++ programing, hoping to get a job in "industry". Now, I've working out of mathematics for about 2 years, still hoping and looking. I just want a job that will use my skills. Work Experience Python Developer Q2Ebanking January 2014 to Present I have recently become a cerified Scrum Master and have been in an agile work environment for the past 4 years. Most of my programing skills are in python, but I am familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases. I have written schemas for SQL Database, Cassandra and Postgress. Recently, I have taught myself Scala in order to create programs that run in Spark on a Cassandra cluster. I developed the unit testing structure for those other programs that run in Spark.
