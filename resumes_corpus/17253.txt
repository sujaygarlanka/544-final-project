Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Network Administrator Computer World - Faisalabad March 1985 to December 1991 They hire all in one guy. So I was not only setting up network but also developing their software. They used to send me to their clients to troubleshoot network, find the problem and fix it.  Then immigrated to USA. One year worked at Complete Computer Cure in Sherman Oaks, CA. Same responsibilities. Going onsite to customer's business location, fix network and any other problem they had.  For the last 14 years, I am with Laptop Expert Las Vegas and fulfill same responsibilities.  Troubleshooting a network is always a fun job form me. Data back up, data transfer, install applications. Once the network is up and running then restore data give them training so, they can handle minor problems.  Realistically, I can work on any windows base network, SQL Server or any other network. I just take15 minutes maximum to figure out, how have they setup up their network, then I am ready to rock and roll.
