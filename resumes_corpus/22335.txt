Founder, Designer, Programmer Gestra Games - Remote August 2017 to October 2018 • Experience developing in C++ and Blueprints, creating game-ready assets, creating a full Unreal Engine game from scratch, and using Git version control.  • Creating Gnosis: A 3D point-and-click game in Unreal Engine 4.16 with the goal of advancing diversity in gaming.  • Worked with writer and voiceover artists to create full story and script for the game.  • Used C++, UMG, and Blueprints in Unreal Engine to create UI and game logic.  • Blender for 3D modeling, GIMP for 2D texture editing and creation. Software Engineer Cognex Corporation - Natick, MA July 2015 to August 2017 • Experience developing in C, debugging on PC using Microsoft Visual Studio, JTAG debugging using TI Code Composer Studio, learning and being able to contribute to a large and complex code base, and using Clearcase and Git version control.  • Worked on 5-person 1D barcode tools team in 25-person ID business unit to improve reading yield and speed of bar codes.  • Created new barcode print quality metrics calculation tool with updated decoder and edge detection modules to replace legacy tool.  • Identified issues in barcode decoder tools such as barcode quiet zone finding or 1D barcode finding and ameliorated them.  • Exposed additional decoder details to performance test for performance analysis and used this data to analyze performance deficits.   • Fixed various 1D decoder bugs filed through Clarify/Dovetail bug tracking system.  • Addressed customer issues for customers including Amazon.  • Analyzed and fixed 1D barcode decoder slowdowns of up to 5-15% between releases.  • Improved yield of low resolution barcode quiet zone finding and increased speed by 5x. Added a quiet zone candidate sorting function, which resulted in overall decoder speedup of 7% while preserving yield.  • Tightened parameters on 1D barcode finder to increase decoder speed-yield curve by ~1% at 30Hz while preserving overall yield.  • Performed experiments in Octave (open-source MATLAB clone) to determine if Harris corner detection could be used to discriminate text from code to save time spent on decoding false barcode candidates in cluttered shipping labels.   • Performed competitive evaluations of other barcode readers on the market to determine problem areas for Cognex readers.
