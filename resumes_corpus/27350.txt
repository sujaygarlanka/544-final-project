Developers are usually stronger in certain skills, but each developer is expected to write code for both front end and back end.  • I helped convert several applications from legacy apps to web based apps. One app is currently used by students at BYU to enable mail forwarding. My app has saved hundreds of hours of manual data entry each semester.
