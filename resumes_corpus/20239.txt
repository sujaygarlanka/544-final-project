C#, VB.NET, SQL Server & ERWin API Developer C#, VB.NET, SQL Server &amp; ERWin API <span class="hl">Developer</span> C#, VB.NET, SQL Server & ERWin API Developer - JP Morgan Chase West Chester, PA Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience C#, VB.NET, SQL Server & ERWin API Developer JP Morgan Chase - Wilmington, DE March 2017 to Present Took ownership of a C#, VB.NET, WinForms application, that uses the COM ERWin API to read ERWin Models into a SQL Server 2012 database. The application produces various reports that standardize the workflow, analysis and reporting of ERWin Model Status across database development teams.    Produced many new SQL, C# & VB.NET, WinForms & Console application features:  • Subversion Interface for Users to unzip & load Erwin Models from SVN URIs.  • Loaded new data from a new tree node in the ERWin API's data store.  • Moved SQL to stored procedures to boost performance.  • Changed and created new Excel Automation.  • Mitigated COM Object cleanup problems, to reduce memory leaks.  • Consumed Ab Initio web services to transform XML to CSV & databases.  • Designed the SQL Server database and wrote the C# to parse Oracle View SQL into the database tables, used by downstream folks for Lineage Analysis.  • Wrote complex SQL Server stored procedures that accept ADO.NET DataTable arguments via user-defined database table types: C#, VB.NET, SQL Server & SSRS Developer Weyandt, LLC August 2016 to January 2017 • Created VS2015 with DevExpress, VS2013 SSRS and SSMS 2016 for SQL Server Azure 2012 software development environments.  • Revised an SSRS report and associated SQL.  • Revised WinForms to layer in "Facility Id" handling.  • Created a new MDI Winforms Project with User Controls.  • Create a new .NET console application to extract, transform and load (ETL) JSON file data into legacy and new SQL Server tables.  ? Created new .NET Middleware and SQL Server Database tables, indexes, foreign keys and stored procedures to persist the new JSON data.  ? Coded blocks of stored procedure calls & SqlBulkCopy database work in .NET transactions.  ? Figured out how to pass a long .NET DataTable to a stored procedure with a SQL Server User Defined Table Type parameter.  ? Created the .NET template class hierarchy for the JSON structures so that each JSON file can be de-serialized into the class hierarchy via one VB.NET statement.    Created new JSON Schema files and .NET code to validate the JSON Data. C#, SQL Server Developer Weyandt, LLC October 2016 to December 2016 120 hours total)    I created a C#, "CSV -> SQLServer Transformer", with a WCF Service Library that can service Windows or Web Forms.    Let's say a person, can "design/specify a Data Warehouse", by simply exporting a group of "views as CSV", into one file folder:    Big Picture: My automation automatically creates the Data Warehouse & transforms and transports the data from the CSV folder shown above.    Details: My automation can allow a user to create and point to Database Schemas where the CSV data will be transformed and transported.    My "Schema-Table focused" stored procedures do all of the database work, except for the dynamic CREATE TABLE SQL building, easier to debug in C#.    My automation loops thru the CSV folder, with CSV files as shown above to  • Compress all (e.g, TimeDetail files shown above) data into one database table  • Dump each file's CSV data into a dynamically created, matching, temporary, all VarChar, temp table in SQL Server  • Automatically scan all the data rows to automatically determine the non-VarChar columns, i.e. bit, int, long, float, date, etc.  • Dynamically build & execute CREATE TABLE SQL to create each Typed database table like this:    • dynamically build and execute INSERT INTO SELECT statements to transform and transport the CSV Data into the Typed Tables with TRY_CAST Columns like this: C#, InterSystems Cache Database & SSRS Developer Radius Global Solutions - Ambler, PA April 2016 to June 2016 Created two, new SSRS reports and associated SQL that  1.
