Algorithm outputs several different  optimized outputs with different priority settings for each parameter.  • Improved room allocation algorithm (whose original optimization technique restricts room arrangement to single hotels) to one that  optimizes room allocation over multiple close-by hotels.  • Developed program (using python, Redis, SQL) for optimizing plane ticket selection through periodically filtering for real-time best- quality API sources. Successfully reduced both the number of API calls and cycles of ticket rating process by 90% through restricting the  selection process to a much smaller optimized dataset. Genome Engineering / Data Analytics Intern Shanghai Ocean University - Shanghai, CN June 2016 to January 2017 June 2016-January 2017  • Generated InDel mutations in the CRHR1 and CRHR2 gene locus of three-month-old zebrafish (Danio rerio) samples through following  MIT's 2013 CRISPR protocol.  • Performed a series of behavioral and physiological trails on mature and successful mutants and determined the CRHR1 was associated with hyperactivity, increased impulsivity, anxiolytic-like behavior, and slow maturation rate.
