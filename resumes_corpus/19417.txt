Python Test Automation Engineer <span class="hl">Python</span> Test Automation Engineer Python Test Automation Engineer - Facebook San Jose, CA Work Experience Python Test Automation Engineer Facebook - Menlo Park, CA February 2017 to Present contract) Shell Scripting  Contributed in Python automation development on Django framework, to Linux implement various test automation functionalities  Matlab  Created shell and python scripts to run on mesh network routers, launched via Django, to implement performance criterion for test pass C, C++ such as minimum, standard deviation, moving average performance of Object Oriented Programming  CPU and Memory consumption of various processes during throughput testing. Perl    To improve bandwidth testing, doing budget build vs buy analysis, I SQL researched and prescribed an x86 based traffic generation method. This involved purchase of right machines, and frugally 'optimizing' the use of CPU resource to power traffic through multiple radios. I also created PRODUCT MANAGEMENT workflow with scripts, to configure new traffic generators, utility scripts Product Management for IoT, to work around for manual debug.  Stanford continuing studies ( Product Idea and Strategy to I brought in Cisco's TRex tool, and adapted it to our IPv6 only product by improve transportation - a hands studying sniffed packets on wireshark, hacking, and creating work on project to create and manage arounds for things it lacked. I demonstrated it could perform the products for IoT ) benchmarks set by iperf, but with more realistic and customisable traffic generation approach. I further demonstrated and outlined approach to Digital Product Management, scale the solution to complex testbeds using virtual machines. UV Darden (Coursera)    Introduced Tableau like dashboards for test performance visibility; Product Ownership  Identified business/ product requirements for the automation; created Feature Ownership tasks and product backlogs for offshore teams  Cross Functional Roles Software Development Engineer in Test Verizon - San Jose, CA January 2016 to February 2017 contract) Agile and Continuous  Developed Python automation from scratch to test media playback, Integration environments platform CLIs, connection and display modes for live IPTV streaming; brought insights to system performance with data plots, visualizations; contributed to Python automation involving monitoring of video DOMAINS streaming from the AWS cloud and created alert system for operations  Wireless Communications (LTE, UMTS, WiFi)    Software Development  Embedded Systems and Test Automation Developer Google - Mountain View, CA December 2015 to December 2016 contract)    I contributed to Python test automation development to test features such Audio DSP as VoLTE, WiFi calling, handover, roving on a python based framework; Video Streaming (involved cross company interactions T Mobile, Qualcomm, Motorola) Lead Test Automation Engineer FAMILIAR - Mountain View, CA January 2014 to August 2014 AWS, Virtualization  I supervised and managed automation development efforts in India. As the Product line and feature owner for 'Always On' technology, I worked PROTOCOL ANALYZERS & extensively on testing/tuning product to customers (Xiaomi, ZTE) TEST TOOLS  Git, Perforce  I worked on systems and algorithms testing, developed automation for testing audio codecs (power, data streaming, voice detection-wake up) Lint, Klocwork Software Developer & Tester Qualcomm - San Diego, CA May 2008 to November 2013 Saleae, Beagle, Wireshark    Introduced static code analysis tool Klocwork and lead memory reduction Audio Precision, Octa Capture efforts for low cost modems. Achieved 15% stack reduction. Resolved software issues, enhanced UTs, created stub codes for tests. Ixia, TRex, iPerf, Agilent,  Aeroflex, Anritsu call  Involved with Lab testing of reference design for cellular, camera, audio, simulators video, WiFi - wrote Perl scripts for regression and functional testing.  Systems testing and failure analysis for 3G, later 4G cellular modems.
