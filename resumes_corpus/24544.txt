Geographic Information Systems Administrator Geographic Information <span class="hl">Systems</span> <span class="hl">Administrator</span> Data Analyst Philadelphia, PA Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Geographic Information Systems Administrator Jacent Strategic Merchandising - Huntingdon Valley, PA March 2018 to May 2019 Coordinated the purchase, testing, and implementation of routing software used to optimize routes for ~14,000 stores being  serviced by ~2,000 merchandisers.  • Handled the geocoding process of store and employee data. Corrected thousands of errors produced by geocoding ~16,000  addresses.  • WebEx's were scheduled and hosted with the 28 territory managers. Each territory contains 300-700 grocery stores and 40-  100 employees. Fostering a report with the managers was key to the success of the project.  • Modeled the routes using the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and then optimized the routes using the desired parameters.  The result was a reduction in mileage, less open stores, and consistent working hours for the FT field staff.  • Developed a process for determining full-time routes and part-time routes. Jacent Retail was in the process of moving from PT field staff to FT & PT. It was difficult to accurately predict the working hours a week for each route until a GIS solution  was produced.  • Implemented vehicle routing from scratch, half a year ahead of schedule, and with 1 employee (4 was the suggested  minimum). The proudest moment of my career was developing a unique solution for a NP-hard vehicle routing problem. Quality Assurance Administrator Jacent Strategic Merchandising - Huntingdon Valley, PA August 2017 to March 2018 Integral to the success of a large-scale new technology rollout. Jacent Inc. switched from orders being faxed to the PA office  to being placed on a smartphone through a mobile application (Movista - One). The QA admin identified potential and current issues integrating our systems with the mobile application.  • Methods for writing the 3rd party service plans, training materials and verifying result data integrity were jobs that needed  creativity to solve. When a new role sprang up out of the merger I was expected to troubleshoot and solve it.  • Billed 3rd party client's for completion of projects. Maintained accurate billing for remote retail work performed nationwide.  • Wrote Excel macros to format data generated by the new app. Prior to using macros reporting was chronically behind schedule, after making macros the reports took a couple seconds to generate.
