Lead Geospatial ESRI .NET/ Python Application Developer Lead Geospatial ESRI .NET/<span class="hl">Python</span> Application <span class="hl">Developer</span> Lead Geospatial ESRI .NET/ Python Application Developer - Kaya Associates Inc Madison, AL Work Experience Lead Geospatial ESRI .NET/ Python Application Developer Kaya Associates Inc - Huntsville, AL March 2010 to Present • Yuma Proving Grounds 2012-16 – Team lead for development of a web based Dig Permit, Work Order and Environmental Management System using ASP.NET MVC/Bootstrap/Leaflet/ArcGIS Server Stack. Developed a predictive model for prehistoric site location analysis for the Cultural Resource directive at YPG, using geostatistics and ESRI’s Spatial Analyst. Also developed datasets, tools and routines for Microsoft Silverlight based GIS Viewer and .NET NITK ESRI ArcGIS Server web implementation using C# and Javascript with Telerik based tools within Visual Studio.    • Ft. Sill Oklahoma 2014 - Developed datasets and tools for .NET NITK ESRI ArcGIS Server. The existing application was updated to 10.0.5 ArcGIS Server from the 9.x series and 10.x series and also uses the Telerik toolkit.    • US Army Reserve Data Conversion 2014 – Developed multiple tools/toolboxes with Python/Modelbuilder & ArcCatalog based interfaces with ArcGIS 10.x for the mass data collection effort. The automation tools were used for the collection of PRISMS based & GIS data for over 250 Army Reserve sites.     • Anniston Army Depot 2013 – implemented a Silverlight API for ArcGIS Server application for Facility Management and Dig Permitting System. The system communicates via Maximo with integrated facilities data linked to GIS assets.    • South Florida Water Management District 2011/12 - team of 3 developers for Silverlight/ASP.NET ArcGIS Server with Oracle 10g. http://cerpmap1.cerpzone.org/arcgisapps/cerpmms/mmsviewer    • Redstone Arsenal 2013 - created an automated mapping system for ingesting field data in custom forms in Microsoft Infopath XML based format & linked the data to GPS surveys. The maps were dynamically updated and delivered to the DPW GIS. GIS Manager/Programmer AGT - Stennis Space Center, MS April 2005 to May 2010 Worked as the GIS Manager for the Environmental Group for Center Operations at SSC. I managed 3 GIS Analysts during Hurricane Katrina recovery and the GIS-based Future Facility Master Planning at SSC for NASA HQ.     • Manager – As part of the Environmental Group at SSC, performed duties in response to Hurricane Katrina, developed portions of the NASA Agency-Wide Environmental GIS website and helped update and automate the collection of information for SSC Natural Resource Management and Site Facilities GIS. Installed ESRI's ArcIMS and ArcGIS Server software and developed websites to display geospatial information.     • CERCLA Chemical Plume Modeling - Installed, managed & developed the GIS database for the spatial plume modeling of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) throughout multiple water bearing zones at multiple sites. Configured ArcSDE 9.1 with SQL Server 2000/05 with the onsite chemical lab’s RLIMS Chemical database. Multi-level contamination plumes were modeled and evaluated from monitored wells' chemical data. With dynamic data, the map products were automated and the process was displayed at the ESRI 2008 User’s Conference & the 2008 NASA Environmental Conference.     • QA/QC of geospatial data for Harris Corporation at Philadelphia, MS. Using ArcGIS PLTS tools and VBA, wrote automation tools, scripts and GUIs for QA/QC tools for the production of TLM50 maps of North Korea for DOD . GIS Programmer/Analyst Michael Baker Jr, Inc. - Calgary, AB March 1999 to April 2005 • Natural Gas Pipeline Design routed from Vegreville, Alberta to Chicago, Illinois. - Aerial photography, along with video was gathered and the photography was converted into Lizardtech’s Mr. Sid format for the ArcSDE database. From the information gathered, a route selection was chosen due to varying engineering factors (wetlands, road crossings, existing structures, water crossings, foreign pipelines, etc.). Any anomalies were collected and researched via fieldwork using GPS. In addition, quick maps were made in an attempt to avoid destroying drain tiles, a costly problem in building an earlier semi-parallel pipeline (Alliance). Environmental and construction alignment sheets were generated for the clients that included Canadian and American wetland information, proposed workspaces, temporary workspaces for construction and management. The data was then incorporated into a database for future facility management.    • Natural Gas Pipeline GIS for State of Alaska – included initial assimilation of multiple competing pipeline ROWs for potential path from Prudhoe Bay to Point MacKenzie. http://www.agdc.us    • CADD/GIS Technology Center, US Army Corp of Engineers, Vicksburg District. Wrote customized programs in AML to create a conversion from optional Data Line Graphs (DLGs) into the attribution of the Tri-Service Spatial Data Standard for ARC/INFO and ArcView (currently known as SDSFIE).     • Nashville Metro Water Services. Developed scripts and procedures for the conversion of raster/vector information of existing water/sewer/wastewater maps into Arc/Info format. The Hansen model information was stripped from existing flat-file format and translated. The area was digitized by Michael Baker Jr., Inc.’s Mexico City office using AutoCad, and the QA/QC programmatically checked for inconsistencies and exported datasets back into Arc/Info with a series of scripts. Education MBA in Management/Finance UAH - Huntsville, AL 2013 to 2015 University of Southern Mississippi - Hattiesburg, MS 1996 to 1998 BS in Chemistry/Mathematics Troy University - Trinity, AL 1992 to 1996 Skills .NET Programming (C#, ASP.NET, MVC, EF) (7 years), SQL Server 2005/20xx (10+ years), ESRI ArcGIS Server Stack (Silverlight/Javascript) Awards STS-119 Award Recipient 2009-05 For post-Katrina contributions to SSC and Environmental group, experienced one of the last Space Shuttle launches.    http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts119/main/ Certifications/Licenses GISP # 91321 Present
