Web Developer Intern <span class="hl">Web</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Intern Web Developer Intern - NeoWare Studios Orlando, FL I'm a Full Stack JavaScript Developer beginning a new career after my completion of the  Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree and Code Fellows coding boot camp. My journey  started a few years ago when I realized that the craft brewing industry was no longer  providing the technical and problem-solving challenges I desired. So I went back to my  previous love for technology. I've completed a dozen projects, including a capstone project (a  MERN Stack SPA) using MongoDB, Express, React, Node, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Google  Maps API, & did 48 peer code reviews. I am excited to start my career by contributing to your  development team. I'm eager to continue learning, open-minded, and passionate about  technology.
