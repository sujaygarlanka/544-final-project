Identified business requirements for migration from legacy Business Intelligence System to the IQ2020 in-house business intelligence data cubes (SQL, C#).  ? Performed 6 client implementations - data sizing, environment / partitioning requirements, ETL implementation, Server setup, collaboration with UI, QA, services and support teams.  ? Optimized implementation process with accelerators / building blocks such as .NET pluggable components that can be adopted for each client implementation. This reduced the implementation time per data set from 4 weeks to 2 days.  ? Automated originally laborious and manual "configuration of the in-house Data cubes partitioning technique" to a one click operation using PowerShell, C++ and SQL. This reduced 90% of the configuration time and any human errors.  ? Designed and implemented a generic ETL process for converting Market research document data to BI cubes. This generic process coupled with research specific configuration excel file reduced implementation time by 80% for every client implementation.
