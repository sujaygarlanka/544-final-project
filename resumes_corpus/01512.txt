I have been employed  in accounting, human resources and managerial positions for over the past 40 years. I feel that my skill sets would  provide a good match with any company.    I have only listed my lasted employer. Prior to that, I was self employed for 8 years doing audits for mystery shopping  companies. This provided me the opportunity to work on a limited basis due to my health issues and still have a way to  provide income for myself.    Prior to that, I worked as Accounting manager and Human Resources manager for several firms, did cost analysis for a  screen printing corporation, owned several small business with my husband, ran a skating rink and opened a  construction company.
