The publishers can further be scored according to advt. categories and geographical locations to provide the best match for an advertiser who wants to run a campaign and generate conversions.  • Assisted in developing a visualization system to compare the performance of ad campaigns over short and long periods of time on various traffic sources based upon cost per acquisition (CPA) and daily revenue. Technologies used were (express.js, async and node.js) Summer Intern Brookhaven National Laboratory June 2011 to August 2011 Worked towards developing a clustering algorithm for astronomical objects mainly Quasars.  • Work involved utilizing the correlation properties of waveforms of night sky objects in order to classify them rather than using  old, time consuming clustering algorithms. All development was done in Python and scientific packages like NumPy and SciPy  were used for mathematical analysis. Research Assistant University of Karlsruhe May 2009 to July 2009 Contributed in developing a Linux based multithreaded program debugger Helgrind+ (http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg- manual.html, an extension of Helgrind) with OpenMP support. Main language used for development was C.  • Improved the efficiency of the debugger by 5 percent by reducing false positives.
