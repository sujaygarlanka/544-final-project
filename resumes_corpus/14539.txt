The agents have full freedom in ‘choosing’ their starting values, goals, as well as if they will share certain information with other agents (so agents have capabilities to cooperate, negotiate, and plan against one another). – Summer 2020     • Taught a programming class my Freshman Year focusing on Full Stack, MEAN, Web Development Spring 2016 – Summer 2016     Experience   STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION STUDENT LIFE APP DEVELOPER & QA TESTER | HARRISBURG UNIVERSITY | JAN 2019 – APRIL 2019   • Helped to develop the app when lead developers were overworked and was responsible for assuring quality code and codebase functionality.

I was responsible for guiding new students around the university and surrounding areas while assisting them in forming lasting professional connections to build their social network.     • Most importantly, however, was my time spent serving in the Boy Scouts of America. During my time here I climbed the ranks and positions to the highest possible peaks the organization had to offer to attain the rank of Eagle Scout. I served as a Senior Patrol Leader for my troop where I was responsible for conducting meetings, hosting workshops to practice our wilderness survival skills such as shelter building and emergency preparedness.
