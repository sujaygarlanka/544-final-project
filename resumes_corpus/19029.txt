Python Developer Dell - Phoenix, AZ June 2014 to March 2015 Description: The product provides re-hosting solution i.e mainframe emulation on Unix Systems at a much lower cost. Users can run their mainframe applications such as Cobol applications directly on Unix systems with this product. This activity involves developing a layer that is common for both Unix and Windows. The layer would provide socket APIs that would be used by application. The layer would abstract Unix and Windows socket related calls based on the platform.  Responsibilities  • Worked as part of Unikix product development team.  • Developing a new abstraction layer/APIs that provides platform independence.  • Doing a proof of concept and finalizing the design for the project.  • Changing application code to use new APIs instead of direct socket calls.  • Testing the changes on both platforms.  • Bug fixing for various other product issues that are raised by end users/clients.    Environment: C, C++, Linux, SUA/Windows. C and C++ Developer IBM November 2011 to March 2014 Description: This module/component is meant to stress/validate cache coherency in Power Systems. The module creates multiple threads bound to different cores and runs the different threads in synchronization such that they hit the same cache line(false sharing) at the same time thereby stressing the cache controller wrt to coherency.    Responsibilities  ? Rewrote cache coherency exerciser on a new framework  ? Adding thread synchronization logic for multiple threads to run together and one at a time.  ? Adding new instructions support in exerciser for newer generations of processor.  ? Owning the component in terms of design, development and maintenance.  ? Designing and developing features in this module.  ? Providing support for defects and other issues to teams who use the module.  ? Unit testing the feature.    Environment: C, C++, Linux, AIX.    Project: PowerPC Core Component Development.  Role: C Developer  Description: Working on module that test the core by creating different load/stress scenarios by mixing and randomizing instructions that are appropriate to stress a particular unit of core such as load/store unit, fixed point unit etc.    Responsibilities:  • Component ownership in terms of design, development and maintenance..  • Enabled module to support 8 threads to run on smt 8(simultaneous multi threading).  • Add support for new instructions added for next gen processor.  • Develop code for features to support new processor specific stress scenarios.  • Unit testing new features.  • Providing support for defects and other issues to teams who use the module    Environment: C, Linux, AIX.  Project: Provide Support for defects raised against the tool.  Role: C Developer  Description: This activity involved screening all defects raised against the any component/module of the tool. The goal is to analyse the defects and isolate actual code issues from setup issues or other environment related bugs like Operating system issues.    Responsibilities:  • Gain code and setup knowledge on almost all modules of the tool.  • Provide analysis and resolution for the defects.  • Unblock the testing teams from various issues with their setup.  • Interacting with testers, other team members and coordinating the bug resolution.    Environment: Linux, AIX. C and C++ Developer Hewlett-Packard January 2007 to July 2011 Description: To reduce the cost of the printer low cost optics (mirror assembly) is used.
