Freelance Web Developer & Graphic Designer Freelance <span class="hl">Web</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> &amp; Graphic Designer Web Development & Graphic Design Frederick, MD I am a freelance Wordpress Developer and Graphic Designer. I am looking to make the transition from a freelancing environment to a full time position. I enjoy working both solo and in a team environment. I feel I bring a wealth of experience to the table including a strong background in development & responsive design for Wordpress & Drupal, as well as graphic design for print and the web. Creativity is my passion. I thrive on thinking out of the box and delivering unique designs.    I consider continual learning and training a must, as web development and design is always rapidly changing and advancing. Learning new technologies and prototyping new strategies and solutions is a passion for me. I quickly learn and adapt to new systems and software, as I enjoy and thrive on new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skillset. I love to work in a team environment and explore new ideas. I enjoy the process of project planning; the process of sharing and receiving insights and knowledge, including discussions on design implementation, future scalability, best practices, architecture planning, pros/cons, timeline, and budget.    If you have any other questions, please feel free to email me at gs@granular.studio. Thank you so much for time and for your consideration. I really look forward to hearing from you.    Jen Wolfe    website: https://www.granular.studio  online resume: https://www.granular.studio/jen-wolfe  online res and download: https://www.granular.studio/jen-wolfe/cv/  linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwolfe-granularstudio/  twitter: @granularstudio / https://twitter.com/granularstudio Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Freelance Web Developer & Graphic Designer Self Employed - Frederick, MD January 2005 to Present Freelance.

I have a passion for consistently honing my skills, and learning new technologies. Love to think out the box, beta develop and test, troubleshoot, and try my hand at anything new.    Design is Art.
