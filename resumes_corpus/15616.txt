All remote access is authenticated using MFA.    • DR is accomplished using vSphere replication and SRM at our remote data center. Redundant Exchange, AD, vCenter and Horizon View servers are live at the DR site.    • Designed and Implemented a system to clean client data before it's used by Relativity (eDiscovery).
