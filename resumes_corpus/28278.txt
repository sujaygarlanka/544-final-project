Web Developer & Owner <span class="hl">Web</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> &amp; Owner Full Stack Web Developer & Ordained Minister Kennewick, WA I'm a full stack web developer with 19 years' part-time experience in the LAMP (PHP), TurboGears (Python), and Node.js/CouchDB/REST/single-page-application (JavaScript) stacks.    I'm fairly solid in using each of the following...    ? Languages: JavaScript, Python, PHP, CSS, HTML, SQL  ? Databases: MySQL, SQLite, CouchDB  ? Frameworks, Libraries & Methods: Single Page Applications, Polymer/ Web Components, AngularJS, Hoodie.js, Backbone, Underscore, Mustache, Require.js, D3.js, Node.js, CouchApps, Bootstrap, jQuery, jQueryUI, EXTJs, TurboGears (SQLObject, SQLAlchemy, ToscaWidgets, Kid, Genshi, MochiKit, Pylons, CherryPy), Django, unit tests, Google Maps API, Joomla – installing, configuring, maintaining, writing custom extensions, Drupal, custom PayPal IPN integration  ? Tools: Git, NPM, Gulp, Grunt, Visual Studio Code, Chrome DevTools, LAMP stack, Docker, MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, cPanel, Github, Trac, ImageMagick, InkScape, Gimp    The stack I enjoy the most is web components on the frontend which sync to a NoSQL data store on the server, and Node.js workers to provide server-side functionality, like Hoodie.js provides.    I get excited about projects which do what no one's done before, and so radically improve a business or people's lives. A few of my papers in college and seminary, my exegesis as a pastor, and my programming projects have had this character. It excites me to use the abilities God has given me to help others and give glory to Him.    I have a gift for understanding what someone means, how things work, what needs to be done to solve a problem, and for teaching it to someone else. I listen, study, and take the time necessary to get these things right. Use me these ways and I'll be a great asset.    ? Ordained Minister    I'm also an ordained minister in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church with 6 years' pastoral experience, grew up in the Reformed faith, studied Biblical Studies at Covenant College, and have an M.Div. from Westminster in PA. I'm taking some years off full-time pastoral ministry to save the money we need for some expected expenses my wife and I couldn't afford on a pastor's salary.
