Now I am trying to switch to Java/Spring stack because of my relocation to US and the fact that proprietary technology I worked with before (Hewlett Packard Service Manager 9.50) is not represented here.  So, I'm currently looking for new opportunities to develop my skills at Java / Spring Boot / Hibernate.
