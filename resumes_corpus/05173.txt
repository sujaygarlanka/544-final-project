Recently, I've worked as a freelance specialist but now I want to concentrate my energy on some project or startup.    7 reasons to work with me:    1. More than 10 years' experience.  2. I'm a front- end developer with a UI/UX designer background, so I know how interfaces work and can implement some tasks without a designer, e. g. make a mobile version of a site on a desktop version basis.  3. Work on a postpay - you risk nothing. If you aren't happy with my services, you don't pay.  4. My services are cheaper than a similar specialist's services in your country, of the same quality.  5. I'm always in touch and perform your tasks in the shortest time.  6. I work with my clients for years.  7. Fluent in English.    Within my 10 years' experience, I've worked with projects of different types and difficulty level, starting from small corporate websites to websites with the audience of 1 million users per month (for example, ski.ru, more than 150 projects in my portfolio). You can take a look at some of my works https://pavelivanov.ru/     If you are interested in cooperation, I could fulfil some tasks for free, so you could be sure of my competence and experience.    Work on software development contract.
