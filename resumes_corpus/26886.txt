Frontend Engineer Frontend Engineer Frontend Engineer - Aerohive Networks Sunnyvale, CA Work Experience Frontend Engineer Aerohive Networks August 2017 to Present I work on feature design and implementation for the HiveManager application. I've implemented a Sass structure to refactor CSS for ease of development and style organization. I've lead a project to propose and convert the non-  componentized Dojo codebase to React in order of much better modularity, plug-in capability, and runtime. Outside of development, I've gained experience leading standup Scrum meetings and lead a team in moving new application  features to a continuous release cycle. Web Developer CNE Machining April 2016 to August 2017 Using my experience building administration tools at SML Engineering, I was asked to build an accounting tool for CNE. Using a PayPal API, I built a one-click ordering system for getting necessary tooling expedited in the shop.  Learning from previous experience, I used a Python and React stack to make use of modern framework practices.  The application reduces production time of some machining jobs from several weeks to less than 7 days. CNC Programmer & Web Developer September 2012 to July 2017 Working as a CNC machinist and programmer, I modeled, programmed, and machined aerospace parts for Boeing, Northrop, and Lockheed. To increase organization and efficiency in the machine shop, I built a proprietary web  application to track tooling purchases and inventory that saved 20% of runtimes. I refactored the tool from using an Angular and PHP stack to more modern technologies as scaling required.
