Senior Software Engineer Altran - Gurgaon, Haryana December 2015 to October 2017 Software Engineer Aricent - Gurgaon, Haryana June 2013 to December 2015 PROJECT:  Mobile Number Portability (MNP)  MNP is a service that allows mobile subscriber to change their subscription from one service provider to another without changing their mobile phone number. Mobile number portability gateway enables number portability for operators in different countries. MNP is supported, validated, enabled, and managed by MCH. Each telecommunications service provider must implement the carrier-level systems NPG to communicate effectively with MCH. All the updates received by NPG are sent to STP (Signal Transfer Point) with the help of applications EPAP, ELAP and LSMS.    EPAP (Eagle Provisioning Application Processor) and ELAP (EAGLE LNP Application Processor) are applications developed by Tekelec (now acquired by Oracle) that runs on a Multi-Purpose Server (MPS) hardware platform to support high speed provisioning of large databases for the EAGLE system. These applications serve two major purposes:  1. Accept and store data provisioned by the customer.  2. Update customer provisioning data and reload databases on the DSM cards in the EAGLE.  LSMS (Local Service Management System) maintains a service provider's LNP (Local Number Portability) data. LNP allows a subscriber to change local service provider, while keeping the same directory number.  EPAP (EAGLE Provisioning Application Processor)  EPAP is a software that runs on an MPS hardware platform. It collects and organizes customer provisioning data and forwards the data to EAGLE service module cards (also known as DSM cards). EPAP provides a shorter database lookup route for certain TCAP queries in a mobile network. EPAP not just contains the GTT tables but also Real Time Database (RTDB) containing the information that formerly resides on the SCP (Service Control Point) or HLR (Home Location Register). EAGLE performs the database lookup and returns the response with the needed information in it without having to inquire the SCP.  I worked on following features on EPAP and ELAP:  1. EPAP Expansion to 480M Database Entries.  2. EPAP SNMP feature.  3. Enhancement features like Support java 1.8 client, MySQL 5.6.31 support  4. ELAP Integration with mainstream TPD as supported on the E5-APP-B card.  5. Support java 1.8 client, MySQL 5.6.31 support, Disable Root access in ELAP.
