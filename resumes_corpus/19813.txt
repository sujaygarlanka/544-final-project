Using simulated data with features characterizing events detected by ATLAS, the task is to classify  events into "tau tau decay of a Higgs boson" versus "background." The Higgs  Boson are a type of unstable subatomic particle that breaks down very quickly.  Scientist studies the decay of the collision and works backwards. To assist  scientist in differentiating the background noise from the signal, we offer some  machine learning algorithms to better predict the Higgs Boson.  Breast Cancer Classification Using R Tensorflow  January 2018 - May 2018  (5 months)  Morris, Minnesota  Breast Cancer Classification Using R Tensorflow by Maligant or Beningn  Tumour Axxelerate - Morris, MN October 2017 to December 2017 Python Based Search Engine Based on Google's Page Rank Sales Axxelerate October 2017 to December 2017 3 months)  A Point of Sale system web application University of Minnesota-Morris - Morris, MN August 2017 to October 2017 USA  A new multiplayer educational vocabulary game.
