So I have knowledge about different frameworks  and currently developing with NodeJs.    Python    I use Python on any project, especially on pla orm specific(armv7, x86) projects. Also some me I need to  make tools for EV project tes ng purposes, than python takes the big play at that mes.    C++    Currently I am working in an electrical vehicle company and me and my team develops applica on for car  with C++ and Qt.    Yocto & Buildroot    While developing any of my C++ car projects, most of the me I sould have a custom kernel. Because of it  should be a custom kernel, I compile my own kernel with Yocto or Buildroot.  Also I am able to compile a fastboot kernel for RaspberryPi which boots up under 2 seconds and runs a Qt  applica on.  To be able to make a fast booted RaspberryPi kernel, I have knowledge about what is RaspberryPi's boot  stage and which modules and services should I included in my custom kernel.
