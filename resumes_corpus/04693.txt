Senior Software Engineer Stanford University November 2017 to April 2018 Python.  • Design and implement Email Alert processing system by converting existing Perl program to Python.  ? Email program is both Python 3.6 and 2.7 compatible. It used a number of conversion capabilities based on the Email, Beautiful Soup and other data conversion systems.  ? The original Perl used Regex extensively and also lacked a menu-driven method to identify types of email. I wrote special Regex functions that returned multiple values so as to modularize and I used a Dict with else to create a proper menu.  ? Output json to MongoDB  ? Testing using nose, pytest.  ?
