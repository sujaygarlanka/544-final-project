In turn, I interact with various doctors, office managers, and other staff to provide all sorts of troubleshooting expertise, whether it be hardware or software related. This requires strong familiarity with the different types of EMR (Electronic Medical Record) systems that many doctors use at their practices. Additionally, I consult with doctors and office managers on ways to streamline and simplify their workflow. For one particular group of doctors, I manage the company-wide email domain, adding users, removing users, enforcing security standards, and other tasks.
