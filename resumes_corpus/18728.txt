I hosted my data on a SQL database and imported specific testing sets into Python. I used machine learning techniques from Sklearn like Natural Language Processing, Clustering, and Predictive Modeling.    SmartAction - RealTime Monitoring  Using PowerBI, I connected a SQL database of task logs to build a real time monitoring dashboard with over 100+ applications performance in real time compared to past performance.    SmartAction - Weekly vs. BiWeekly  Engineers complained they did not have enough time to work on projects and I realized the root of the issue was weekly meetings with clients. I showed that moving to biweekly meetings would not only save the company $50,000 a month in overhead costs but would provide engineers an additional 8 hours development time per week.
