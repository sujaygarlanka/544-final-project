Then we will describe the hash function, Cubehash, which is one of the competitors in the competition held by NIST for selecting SHA-3 standard. In chapter 3 we will describe an attack based on linearization of the differential paths in hash functions and apply this attach on Cubehash. We will discuss the results of the attack and the comparison between the practical and theorical results on Cubehash in the last chapter.
