ASSISTANT VP, SENIOR ORACLE DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR ASSISTANT VP, SENIOR ORACLE <span class="hl">DATABASE</span> <span class="hl">ADMINISTRATOR</span> Redding, CA I would like to introduce myself. My name is Trina Martinez. I am a technical, dedicated professional with over 33 years of experience, exceptional analytical, problem-solving and communication skills. I am seeking a new and challenging role with a progressive and forward thinking company who would greatly benefit from my experience, knowledge and work ethic.    What makes me unique from others candidates is my passion, dedication and loyalty. To me clients include anyone I am in contact with. I thrive on contributing and being part of the success as well as wallow in the mud when a puzzle needs to be solved or improvements need to be made. I like to work hard and play hard and strive for work/life balance and to help others to do the same. I enjoy finding the humor in situations to lighten the burden of daily work so it’s enjoyable for those I am surrounded by. I have compassion and empathy which drives me to be very committed to those around me. Being a motorcyclist gives you a sense of comradery, strength, stick-to-itiveness and levity. It gives one perspective and focus and the opportunity to be in the environment rather than just observing. I do the same with work.
