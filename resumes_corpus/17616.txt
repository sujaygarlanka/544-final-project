I have thirty five years of experience beginning in 1988 when I was named the System Administrator for the Burke company tasked with installing their new Apollo UNIX CAD systems. Over the succeeding 4 years I became the Senior Administrator responsible for 7 offices scattered over the United States and Canada. After the company downsized the engineering department in anticipation of closing operations I took a year off of work to spend with my new born daughter. I then went to work for Bechtel Construction providing network / system administration support to the Santa Clara County Traffic authority. Over the following 17 years I worked for 19 different firms in contract and permanent positions always in a System or Network Administration roll. Always preforming duties normal to that generic job title primarily working with Novell Netware and Windows desktop and eventually working with Windows server administration and Linux servers. As I worked in these position I have learned customer service, project management skills as well as how to quickly research problems to find viable solutions. I have also picked up networking maintenance and design experience since in nearly ever case I have gone to work for firms that have issues of one sort or another or that are just needing upgrading. I did obtain my Cisco CCNA certification and followed by then obtaining the CCNP certification. Both have expired and I haven't had a opportunity to renew them for the last 6 years.
