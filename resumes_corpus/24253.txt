Systems Administrator <span class="hl">Systems</span> <span class="hl">Administrator</span> System Administrator Seguin, TX My Name is Dennis Kirkland, and am interested in applying for a Technology position listed on the indeed.com website.     From June 2015 to June 2019 I was a Systems Administrator for the City of Seguin. My duties include the implantation and support of all computer systems with in the city. Including all virtual and physical servers and all networking devices in the city. I have used PowerShell to automate vital processes and am constantly looking for more ways to streamline the workload of the IT department with automated scripts.     From April 2013 till February 2015 I left the IT field to be a full-time Deputy Sheriff responsible for the enforcement, protection, safety and welfare of citizens and property under the jurisdiction of my County. While there, I took it upon myself to update the computers accessible by the patrol deputies. I created a wireless network shared network resources and changed out defective computer components.     I have worked as a Computer Services Manager at Limestone County Detention Center in Groesbeck, Texas, where I was responsible for supporting and maintaining two corporate networks and a separate Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) network required for facility operations. I gave technical expertise to our corporate IT office in Massachusetts with purchasing recommendations, and local budgeting requirements, while I conducted training on proper computer usage and data security as it relates to a prison environment. I was also responsible for the installation, configuration, and maintenance of local Windows XP and Windows 7 workstations, Novell electronic mail system, user creation and management, inventory control of electronic equipment as well as daily backup services for the Federal BOP network.     Going further back, for eleven years my jobs focused on educational environments as a Computer/Network Specialist, Network Administrator and Director of Technology. During this time, I worked with State and Federal offices for infrastructure funding and compliance, helped design and implement secure layered Windows networks with large multi-site segments, installed and maintained VOIP networks, reduced overall cost of ownership with the implementation of Open Source alternatives (Applications and operating systems) when it made sense to do so and found less expensive but fully functional alternatives at every opportunity.     Finally, I hope to combine the skills gained from previous experience in customer relations, computer repair and law enforcement experience to benefit your company and clients.     Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.     Sincerely,     Dennis L.
